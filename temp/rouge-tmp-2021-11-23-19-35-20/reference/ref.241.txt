Given a data-point z = (x, y) ∈ X × Y, ℓ( ˆ f , z) measures the difference betweenˆf betweenˆ betweenˆf (x) and the true label y. Let F d,HS be the hypothesis class of d-dimensional halfspaces 1 , used for binary classification. While one school of thought relies on the stopping criteria based on the intrinsic measure of stability or self-confidence within the learner, another believes that it is based on economic or other external factors (refer [50, Section 6.7]).
