We argue that it is essential to distinguish the contribution of the preposition itself, i.e., what the adposition codes for, from the semantic role or relation that the adposition mediates and that a predicate or scene calls for; and as a result, the label that would be most appropriate is underdetermined for many tokens ( ยง3). For example, the preposition at expresses different information in each of the following usages:( When confronted with a new instance of at, NLU systems must determine whether it marks an entity or scene's location, time, goal, or something else.As lexical classes go, prepositions are something of a red-headed stepchild in the linguistics literature. The Preposition Project (TPP; Litkowski and Hargraves, 2005) broke ground in stimulating computational work on fine-grained word sense disambiguation of English prepositions ( Litkowski and Hargraves, 2005;Ye and Baldwin, 2007;Tratz and Hovy, 2009;Dahlmeier et al., 2009). Following Srikumar and Roth (2013b), Schneider et al. (2015) developed coarse-grained semantic categories of prepositions as a broader-coverage alternative to finegrained senses, using categories similar to those appearing in semantic maps (LOCATION, RECIPIENT, etc.) rather than lexicalized senses. While the above approach works reasonably well for most English tokens, difficulties in directly applying the scheme to adpositions and case markers in other languages, as well as some of the persistent issues arising in English, have led us to conclude that perhaps the supersense hierarchy as it stands is too simplistic to provide a faithful account of the prepositions' semantic behavior. However, supersense organization does not make any claims with regard to coreness or the argument/adjunct distinction, as there are many phenomena that do not conform to either of the prototypes for argument and adjunct (for a review of the literature on the argument/adjunct distinction, see Hwang, 2011). Here Bipasha is not construed as a possessor when the postposition kaa is not used.Our preliminary annotation of Hindi, Korean, and Hebrew has suggested that instances of overlap between multiple supersenses are fairly frequent. With "cared about the strategy," it is TOPIC-ness that the preposition brings to the table; with "anger of Bipasha," it is the conceptualization of anger as an attribute that somebody possesses.Thus, we turn to theories in Cognitive Semantics to define the phenomenon of construal as a means of understanding the contributions that are emerging from the adpositions with respect to the expressed event or situation. In the process called construal (a.k.a. conceptualization), a speaker "packages" ideas for linguistic expression in a way that foregrounds certain elements of a situation while backgrounding others.We propose to incorporate this notion of construal in adposition supersense annotation. I'm an expert on the works of Puccini.While both prepositional phrases indicate works created by the operatic composer Puccini (i.e., CRE-ATOR), the different choices of preposition reflect different construals: by highlights the agency of Puccini, whereas of construes Puccini as the source of his composition. Rather than trying to ignore these construals to favor a single-label approach, or possibly create new labels to capture the meaning distinctions that construals impose on semantic roles, we adopt an approach that gives us the flexibility to deal with both the semantics coming from the scene and the construal evoked by the adpositional choice. The festival features works by Puccini.scene role: CREATOR; function: AGENT b. I'm an expert on the works of Puccini.scene role: CREATOR; function: SOURCE We recognize that both of these sentences carry the meaning represented by the supersense CREATOR at the scene level, but also recognize the construal that arises from the chosen preposition: by is assigned the function of AGENT and of is assigned the function of SOURCE. For example, Alex in Alex sent the package to Pam can be AGENT or SOURCE depending whether the interpretation is focused on the agency of the argument or the spatial relation it has in reference to the action described by the verb. The owners and employees of this store ...PROFESSIONALASPECT;POSSESSOR All of these construals are motivated in that they highlight an aspect of prototypical professional relationships: e.g., an employee's work prototypically takes place at the business location (hence "work at"), though this is not a strict condition for using "work at"-the meaning of at has been extended from the prototype. In our terms, we simply say that the scene calls for a DESTINATION, but the preposition codes for a LOCATION: The opposite problem occurs with fictive motion (Talmy, 1996): a path PP, and sometimes a motion verb, construe a static scene as dynamic as seen in "A road runs through my property." Candidates for removal include the labels with multiple inheritance such as CONTOUR (inheriting from PATH and โข Items in the PARTICIPANT subhierarchy are prototypically entities functioning as arguments to an event. A significantly smaller inventory will both ease the cognitive burden on annotators and reduce the sparsity of labels in the data, which should facilitate better statistical generalizations with limited data.The added representational complexity of construals seems justified to account for many of the phenomena discussed above, especially as the project grows to include more languages. Such construals are not limited to locations, but may also include other scene roles such as GOAL and ACCOMPANIER, in alternation with postpositions that can express those functions. A similar phenomenon can be found in Hindi: This suggests that, apart from spatiotemporal relations and semantic roles, adpositions can mark information structural properties for which we would need a separate inventory of labels. As we are approaching this project with the goal of producing annotated datasets for training and evaluating natural language understanding systems, it is an important concern.We are currently planning pilot annotation studies to ascertain (i) the prevalence of the role vs. function mismatches, and (ii) annotator agreement on such instances. Enshrining role-function pairs in the lexicon may facilitate inter-annotator consistency: our experience thus far is that annotators benefit greatly from examples illustrating the possible supersenses that can be assigned to a preposition.If initial pilots are successful, we would then need to decide whether to annotate the role and function together or in separate stages. Existing annotations for lexical resources such as PropBank ( Palmer et al., 2005), VerbNet (Palmer et al., 2017;Kipper et al., 2008), and FrameNet ( Fillmore and Baker, 2009) might go a long way toward disambiguating the scene role, limiting the effort required from annotators. We thank the rest of our CARMLS team-Martha Palmer, Ken Litkowski, Omri Abend, Katie Conger, and Meredith Green-for participating in weekly discussions of adposition semantics; Michael Ellsworth for an insightful perspective on construal, Paul Portner for a helpful clarification regarding approaches to conceptualization in the literature, and anonymous reviewers for their thoughtful comments.
