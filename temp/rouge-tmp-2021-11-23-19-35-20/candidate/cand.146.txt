We demonstrate that an Internet of Things (IoT) bot-net of high wattage devices-such as air conditioners and heaters-gives a unique ability to adversaries to launch large-scale coordinated attacks on the power grid. In particular, we reveal a new class of potential attacks on power grids called the Manipulation of demand via IoT (MadIoT) attacks that can leverage such a botnet in order to manipulate the power demand in the grid. This work sheds light upon the in-terdependency between the vulnerability of the IoT and that of the other networks such as the power grid whose security requires attention from both the systems security and power engineering communities. In this paper, we reveal another substantial way that compromised IoT devices can be utilized by an adversary to disrupt one of the most essential modern infrastructure networks, the power grid.Power grid security standards are all based on the assumption that the power demand can be predicted reliably on an hourly and daily basis [62]. However, with the ubiquity of IoT devices and their poor security measures (as shown in [12]), we demonstrate that this is no longer a safe assumption.There has been a recent trend in producing Wi-Fi enabled high wattage appliances such as air conditioners, water heaters, ovens, and space heaters that can now be controlled remotely and via the Internet [3] (for the power consumption of these devices see Table 1). A group of these devices can also be controlled remotely or automatically using smart thermostats or home assistants such as Amazon Echo [1] or Google Home [4]. Hence, once compromised, any of these devices can be used to control high wattage appliances remotely by an adversary to manipulate the power demand.In this paper, we reveal a new class of potential attacks called the Manipulation of demand via IoT (MadIoT) attacks that allow an adversary to disrupt the power grid's normal operation by manipulating the total power demand using compromised IoT devices (see Fig. 1). Power Usage (í µí± ) Air Conditioner 1,000 Space Heater 1,500 Air Purifier 200 Electric Water Heater 5,000 Electric Oven 4,000 the system is stabilized by the primary controller of the generators. Nevertheless, we provide sketches of countermeasures against the MadIoT attacks from both the power grid and the IoT perspectives.Overall, our work sheds light upon the interdependency between the vulnerability of the IoT and that of other networks such as the power grid whose security requires attention from both the systems security and the power engineering communities. The electric power is generated at power generators at different locations with different capacities and then transmitted via a high voltage transmission network to large industrial consumers or to the lower voltage distribution network of a town or a city. If the frequency goes above or below a threshold value, protection relays turn off or disconnect the generators completely (see Fig. 4 for normal and abnormal frequency ranges in North America). Hence, within seconds of the first signs of decrease in the frequency, the primary controller activates and increases the mechanical input which increases the speed of the generator's rotor and correspondingly the frequency of the system [26]. Voltage collapse should be studied using í µí± -í µí± (characterizing the relationship between the voltage at the terminating bus of a line to the reactive power flow) and í µí± -í µí± (characterizing the relationship between the voltage at the terminating bus of a line to the active power flow) analysis which is beyond the scope of this paper, but for more details see [62, Chapter 7]. Hence, even failures in a few lines or an increase in the active/reactive power demands may result in large scale outages around the grid due to voltage collapse. The adversary's power to manipulate the demand can also be translated into watts (í µí± ) using the numbers in Table 1 and based on the type and the number of devices to which it has access.For example, if we consider only the houses with smart thermostats in 2018 as shown in Fig. 5 and assuming that each thermostat only controls two 1í µí±í µí± air conditioners, an attacker can potentially control 35í µí°ºí µí± of electric power 2 -even a fraction of which is a significant amount. Here, we present the most im-portant and direct ways that such attacks can cause damage to the grid (summarized in Table 2):1. Sudden decrease in the demand may also result in the same effect but this time by causing a sudden rise in the frequency.An adversary can further increase its success by strategic selection of the timing of an attack using the online data available via the websites of Independent System Operators (ISOs) 3 (e.g., daily fuel mix and live updates of the demand values.) According to the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSOE) guidelines, if the frequency of the European grid goes below 47.5í µí°»í µí± § or above 51.5í µí°»í µí± §, a blackout can hardly be avoided [25]. Failure in one of these lines may result in a huge power deficit (usually more than 1í µí°ºí µí± ) in the receiving ISO and most likely a blackout due to the subsequent frequency disturbances or a large-scale outage due to load shedding by the grid operator.Due to their importance, the tie-lines can be the target of an adversary. Thus, using the reserve generators can significantly increase the power generation cost for the grid operator but at the same time be profitable for the utility that operates the reserve generator.Hence, the goal of an adversary's attack may be to benefit a particular utility in the electricity market rather than to damage the infrastructure. Moreover, the attack may not be noticeable by the households since the changes are temporary and can be considered as part of the automatic temperature control.Second, the MadIoT attacks are easy to repeat. For example, the initial reactive power deficit in Ohio in 2003 leading to the large-scale blackout in the U.S. and Canada [60], and the failures in the tielines connecting Italy to Switzerland in 2003 leading to the complete shutdown of the Italian grid [59], could have been caused by MadIoT attacks. Most of these events happened beacuse the systems' operators were not prepared for the unexpected initial event. In this section, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the MadIoT attacks on real-world power grid models via state-of-the-art simulators. Therefore, the outcome of an attack highly depends on the operational properties of the targeted system at the time of the attack (e.g., generators' settings, amount of renewable resources, and power flows). We emphasize this in our simulations by changing the power grid models' parameters to reflect the daily changes in the operational properties of the system. PowerWorld, on the other hand, is an industrial-level software suite that is widely used by the industry for frequency stability analysis of power systems. Hence, for evaluating the effects of the MadIoT attacks on the system's frequency, we use the WSCC 9-bus grid model that represents a simple approximation of the Western System Coordinating Council (WSCC)-with 9 buses, 9 lines, and 315í µí±í µí± of demand [35]. 5 We use the Polish grid data at its Summer 2004 peak-with 2736 buses, 3504 lines, and 18GW of demand-and at its Summer 2008 peak-with 3120 buses, 3693 lines, and 21GW of demand. Once a generator goes below or above these values, it gets disconnected from the grid by protective relays.As can be seen in Figs. 7(b) and 8(b), sudden increase or decrease in the load buses by 30% or 20%, respectively, cause the system's frequency to go below or above the frequency cut-off limits. Hence, an adversary requires 200-300 bots/í µí±í µí± , or in this case 60-90 thousand bots, to perform these attacks.As can be seen, however, the drop/rise in frequency is higher in the low inertia case (as predicted). As can be seen, the grid completely shuts down and the simulations stop in less than 10 seconds due to disconnection of the generators.Simulation results in this subsection demonstrate that the effectiveness of an attack in causing a critical frequency disturbance depends on the attack's scale as well as the system's total inertia at the time of the attack. In this case, the frequency goes slightly below the minimum safe limit, but it is common in the black start process that the generators' lower (upper) frequency limits are set to lower (higher) levels than usual. Therefore, even if the big drop in frequency of island 1 (1í µí°»í µí± § below the safe limit) is acceptable during the black start, island 2 goes back to the blackout state.For comparison purposes and to reflect on the role of the operational properties of the system on the outcome of an attack, we repeated the same set of simulations with different maximum power outputs for the generators' governors (see Fig. B.1 up to 10í µí±í µí± results is a successful black start, unlike the previous case which could handle demand increases of 20í µí±í µí± at all the loads. Despite balancing the supply and demand, since this balancing is unplanned, it may cause line overloads.To demonstrate this, we assume that an adversary increases the demand at all the load buses by 1%. However, unlike the large botnet size (about 300 bots/í µí±í µí± ) required to cause a blackout from frequency instability in the system, we observe here that even botnet size of 10 bots/í µí±í µí± can result in a significant blackout depending on the grid's operational properties. In order to demonstrate an attack on the tie-lines as described in Section 3.2, since we do not have access to the European grid or the U.S. Eastern Interconnection, we modified the Polish grid 2008 in a principled manner to represent a few neighboring ISOs in Europe connected by a few tie-lines. In this variation of the attacks, an adversary increases the demand not to necessarily cause a blackout, but rather to significantly increase the operating cost of the grid in favor of a utility in the electricity market. To simulate the system in its peak demand state, we increase the initial demand by 10% to make the demand before the attack close to the online generators' generation capacity.We assume that the sudden increase in the demand caused by the attack can temporarily be handled by the primary controller and no large frequency drops as in Section 4.2 happen in any of the scenarios here. The í µí± 1 (í µí±¥) is selected similarly to cost function of the high-cost online generators in the grid before the attack and the í µí± 2 (í µí±¥) is selected to capture the start-up cost of the reserve generators as well as their higher cost compared to the online generators. An adversary can directly get access to the device, or get access to the mobile phone, tablet, or a thermostat that controls that device, or with the ubiquity of digital home assistant devices such as Amazon Alexa or Google Home, an adversary can control smart appliances by getting access to these devices. In a recent study of the DDoS attack by the Mirai botnet [12], Antonakakis et al. showed that due to poor security measures in the IoT devices, such as easy to guess default passwords, an attacker could get access to about 600 thousand devices from cameras to DVRs and routers in a very short period. It was also shown by Hernandez et al. that the lack of proper hardware protections in Nest thermostats allows attackers to install malicious software on these devices [33]. In another recent work [49], Ronen et al. demonstrated that the smart lights within a city can potentially be compromised by creating a worm that can affect all the lamps using Zigbee. Amini et al. [11] have also recently studied the effects of load altering attacks on the dynamics of the system and ways to use the system's frequency as feed-back to improve an attack. In two very recent papers, Dvorkin and Sang [24], and Dabrowski et al. [19] independently revealed the possibility of exploiting compromised IoT devices to disrupt normal operation of the power grid. To the best of our knowledge, however, the work presented in this paper provides the most coherent and complete study on the effects of potential attacks on the power grid using high wattage IoT devices.There is another line of research that focuses on privacy of the customers in the presence of smart power meters which is beyond the scope of our paper [30]. First, as mentioned in Section 4, we have only used publicly available data sets that may not exactly reflect the characteristics of all existing power grids. Moreover, other varieties of the MadIoT attacks that do not require synchronicity on the scale of seconds (e.g., line failures) can still be performed using air conditioners.Finally, unlike DDoS attacks, for the MadIoT attacks, the IoT bots should all be geographically located within boundaries of a power system. We have studied the collective effects of vulnerable high wattage IoT devices and have shown that once compromised, an adversary can utilize these devices to perform attacks on the power grid. In particular, our work leads to following recommendations for the research community:Power systems' operation: Power systems' operators should rigorously analyze the effects of potential MadIoT attacks on their systems and develop preventive methods to protect their systems. In a relatively hot summer day (but not the hottest day), an adversary could have initiated the same event by overloading the Ohio system by increasing the reactive power demand by remotely starting several air conditioners. At around 3pm in the afternoon, Italy was importing 3, 610í µí±í µí± and 2, 212í µí±í µí± of power from Switzerland and France, about 600í µí±í µí± and 400í µí±í µí± above their scheduled exchange agreements, respectively. This resulted in a huge imbalance between supply and demand within Italy and a frequency drop that could not be recovered despite further aggressive load shedding. An adversary could actively monitor the power flow on the tie-lines through European grids' websites and overload the tie-lines by increasing power demand in Italy and possibly decreasing power demand in Switzerland or France. A.4 The 2016 Blackout in South AustraliaThe September 28, 2016, blackout in South Australia affected approximately 1 million customers. An adversary could actively monitor the power flow on the tie-lines through European grids' websites and overload the tie-lines by increasing power demand in Italy and possibly decreasing power demand in Switzerland or France.
