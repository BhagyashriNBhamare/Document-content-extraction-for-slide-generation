Pseudorandom sequences with good correlation properties are widely used in communications and cryptography.
The search of new sequences with two-level autocorrelation has been a very interesting problem for decades.
In 2002, Gong and Golomb proposed the iterative decimation-Hadamard transform (DHT) which is an useful tool to study two-level autocorrelation sequences.
They showed that for all odd n ≤ 17, using the second-order decimation-Hadamard transform, and starting with a single binary m-sequence, all known two-level autocorrelation sequences of period 2 n − 1 which have no subfield factorization can be obtained.
In this paper, we find many new ternary or quaternary sequences with two-level autocorrelation using the second-order decimation-Hadamard transform.
The period of such sequences is 2 n − 1.

Pseudorandom sequences with good correlation properties have been widely used in modern communication systems and cryptography, such as radar, global positioning systems, CDMA communication systems, and stream cipher cryptosystems [6,7,20].
The search for new sequences with two-level autocorrelation has been an interesting research topic in application areas for some decades [7,13,14,19].
In recent some years, significant progress has been made in finding new sequences with two-level autocorrelation.
Several new classes of sequences with two-level autocorrelation have been discovered 1 which are summarized in [7] or in the literature [2,3,10,11,14,17,18,19].
In 2002, motivated by the idea of Dillon and Dobbertin in [2,3], Gong and Golomb proposed the iterative decimation-Hadamard transform (DHT) [9].
For search of new sequences with two-level autocorrelation, they showed that for all odd n ≤ 17, using the second-order DHT (which will be defined later), and starting with a single binary m-sequence, all the known binary two-level autocorrelation sequences of period 2 n −1 which have no subfield factorization can be obtained.
They also conjectured that all families of cyclic Hadamard difference sets of period 2 n − 1 having no subfield factorization are now known, at least for odd n.Yu and Gong generalized the second-order DHT to two-level autocorrelation sequences with subfield factorization (i.e., generalized GMW sequences) [21], and to the case of n even which is referred to as the multiplexing DHT.
They showed that experimentally satrting with a single m-sequence with period 2 n − 1, n even and n ≤ 16, all known binary two-level autocorrelation sequences can be realized by the second-order multiplexing DHT.
Thus, using the second-order DHT, any known binary two-level autocorrelation sequence can be realized by either the DHT or the multiplexing DHT.
However, there is no binary two-level autocorrelation sequence which has been foung by this method.
In [16], applying the second-order DHT to ternary sequences over F 3 with period 3 n − 1, some new classes of ternary sequences of period 3 n − 1 with two-level autocorrelation have been found experimentally.
However, their proof has not been appeared in the literature yet.In this paper, we revisit the second-order DHT of m-sequences.
We observe that if we allow the sequence element could be taken from an enlarged alphabetic set, then under certain conditions, the second-order DHT of m-sequences of period 2 n −1 produces new sequences with two-level autocorrelation whose elements are from the rational field.
In some cases, we prove that these sequences are ternary or quaternary using Dobbertin's method.
Based on such sequences, new Hadamard matrixes with entries in {−1, 0, 2} or {−1, 0, 1, 2 d } can be constructed, where d will be defined later.
This paper is organized as follows.
In Section 2, we provide some notation and background which will be used.
In Section 3, the new construction is given.
In Section 4, we present new ternary and quaternary sequences with two-level autocorrelation of period 2 n − 1.
Finally, Section 5 concludes this paper.
Let s = {s i } be a complex-valued sequences with period N .
Then the autocorrelation C s (τ ) of s at shift τ is defined byC s (τ ) = N −1 i=0 s i+τ s i , 0 ≤ τ < N,where s i is the complex conjugate of s i .
Definition 1 ( [7]) A sequence s = {s i } with period N is called a two-level sequence if C s (τ ) = −1 for any 0 < τ < N .
Let F q denote the finite field of order q, where q is the power of a prime number p, and T r(·) denote the trace map from F q to F p .
Let ω = e 2πi/p , a complex primitive pth root of unity.
The canonical additive character χ of F p is defined by [15] χ(x) = ω x , x ∈ F p .
Definition 2 Let h(x) be a function from F q to F p with h(0) = 0.
h(x) is called orthogonal if and only if x∈Fq χ(h(λx))χ(h(x)) = 0, ∀λ ∈ F q , λ = 1.
Let f (x) be a polynomial from F q to F p .
Then the Hadamard transform of f (x) is defined by f (λ) = x∈Fq χ(T r(λx))χ(f (x)), λ ∈ F q ,and the inverse transform is given byχ(f (λ)) = 1 qHenceforth we take h(x) = T r(x).
For simplicity, we denotef h (v)(λ) and f h (v, t)(λ) by f (v)(λ) and f (v, t)(λ) respectively.
Let n be an integer, and 1 ≤ k < n with gcd(k, n) = 1.
Let 1 ≤ k < n be the multiplicative inverse of k modulo n, i.e., k k ≡ 1 mod n.
We introduce the following sequences of polynomials over F 2 n :A 1 (x) = x, A 2 (x) = x 2 k +1 , A i+2 (x) = x 2 (i+1)k A i+1 (x) + x 2 (i+1)k −2 ik A i (x), i ≥ 1, B 1 (x) = 0, B 2 (x) = x 2 k −1 , B i+2 (x) = x 2 (i+1)k B i+1 (x) + x 2 (i+1)k −2 ik B i (x), i ≥ 1.
They are used to define the polynomialR k,k (x) = k i=1 A i (x) + B k (x).
(1)Note that the exponents occurring in A j (resp.
in B j ) are precisely those of the forme = j−1 i=0 (−1) εi 2 ik ,where ε i ∈ {0, 1} satisfy ε j−1 = 0, ε 0 = 0 (resp.
ε 0 = 1), (ε i , ε i−1 ) = (1, 1).
In [5], Dobbertin proved that the polynomialS k,k (x) = k i=1 x 2 ik + k + 1 x 2 k +1is a permutation polynomial over F * 2 n .
(Strictly speaking, we obtain a polynomialS k,k (x) if 1/x 2 k +1is replaced by x 2 n −1−(2 k +1) .)
Moreover, for any x ∈ F * 2 n , he proved thatR k,k ((S k,k (x)) −1 ) = x. For any polynomial f (x) from F q to F p , and any integers 0 < v, t < q − 1, we define the sequence s = {s i } bys i = f (v, t)(α i )/q, i = 0, 1, 2, ...(2)For the convenience of notation, we denote this sequence by s(v, t).
Theorem 1 With the notation as above, let s(v, t) be defined by (2) with gcd(vt, q − 1) = 1.
If the se-quence {ω f (α i ) } given by f (x) has two-level autocorrelation, then the autocorrelation function C s(v,t) (τ ) of s(v, t) satisfies C s(v,t) (τ ) = q − 1, if τ ≡ 0 mod (q − 1); −1, otherwise.
Proof.
For any λ ∈ F 2 n , f (v, t)(λ) = x∈Fq χ(T r(λx)) f (v)(x t ) = x,y∈Fq ω T r(λx)−T r(x t y)+f (y v ) .
Thus, for any τ , we haveC s(v,t) (τ ) = q−2 i=0 s i+τ s * i = q−2 i=0 x1,y1∈Fq ω T r(α i+τ x1)−T r(x t 1 y1)+f (y v 1 ) x2,y2∈Fq ω −T r(α i x2)+T r(x t 2 y2)−f (y v 2 ) /q 2 .
Thus, we computeq 2 · C s(v,t) (τ ) = (q − 1) α τ x1=x2,y1,y2∈Fq ω −T r(x t 1 y1)+f (y v 1 )+T r(x t 2 y2)−f (y v 2 ) − α τ x1 =x2,y1,y2∈Fq ω −T r(x t 1 y1)+f (y v 1 )+T r(x t 2 y2)−f (y v 2 ) = q x1,y1,y2∈Fq ω −T r(x t 1 y1)+T r(α tτ x t 1 y2)+f (y v 1 )−f (y v 2 ) − x1,x2,y1,y2∈Fq ω −T r(x t 1 y1)+f (y v 1 )+T r(x t 2 y2)−f (y v 2 ) = q 2 y1∈Fq ω f (y v 1 )−f (α −tvτ y v 1 ) − q 2 .
If τ ≡ 0 mod (q − 1), then y1∈Fq ω f (y v 1 )−f (α −tvτ y v 1 ) = 0 since the sequence {ω f (α i ) } has two-level autocorrelation and gcd(vt, q − 1) = 1.
Otherwise, y1∈Fq ω f (y v 1 )−f (α −tvτ y v 1 ) = q.So the result follows.Remark 3 If p = 2, then the elements of s(v, t) are from the rational field Q.
In some cases, they are from the integer ring Z.
In this section we consider the case of p = 2, f (x) = T r(x), v = 2 n−1 − 1, and t = 2 k + 1.
The following theorem is the main result.Theorem 2 Let n be an integer, and 1 ≤ k < n with gcd(k, n) = d and n/d is odd.
Let f (x) = T r(x), and s(v, t) = {s i } be defined by (2) N −1 = 2 (m+1)d + 2 d 2(2 d + 1) , N 0 = 2 (m−1)d − 1, N 1 = (2 d − 2)(2 md − 1) 2(2 d − 1) , N 2 d = 2 (m−1)d − 1 2 2d − 1 .
Corollary 1 With the same notation as in Theorem 2, if n is odd, and gcd(k, n) = 1, thenN −1 = 2 n + 1 3 , N 0 = 2 n−1 − 1, N 1 = 0, N 2 = 2 n−1 − 1 3 .
Thus, in this case, we obtain two-level ternary sequences with elements taken from {−1, 0, 2}.
Corollary 2 With the same notation as in Theorem 2, if n = 2m with m odd, and gcd(k, n) = 2, thenN −1 = 2 n+1 + 2 5 , N 0 = 2 n−2 − 1, N 1 = 2 n − 1 3 , N 4 = 2 n−2 − 1 15 .
Thus, in this case, we obtain two-level quaternary sequences with elements taken from {−1, 0, 1, 4}.
For the case of n = 5 or 6, we list the data below.
Table 1: n = 5 In order to prove Theorem 2, we need some lemmas.

For any a ∈ F * 2 n , the equation x 2 k +1 + x + a = 0 has 0, 1, 2, or 2 d + 1 roots in F 2 n .
For i ∈ {0, 1, 2, 2 d + 1}, let N i denote the number of a ∈ F * 2 n such that x 2 k +1 + x + a = 0 has exactly i roots in F 2 n .
Set m = n/d.
If m is odd, then N 0 = 2 (m+1)d + 2 d 2(2 d + 1) , N 1 = 2 (m−1)d − 1, N 2 = (2 d − 2)(2 md − 1) 2(2 d − 1) , N 2 d +1 = 2 (m−1)d − 1 2 2d − 1 .
If m is even, thenN 0 = 2 (m+1)d − 2 d 2(2 d + 1) , N 1 = 2 (m−1)d , N 2 = (2 d − 2)(2 md − 1) 2(2 d − 1) , N 2 d +1 = 2 (m−1)d − 2 d 2 2d − 1 .
Lemma 2 ( [12]) Let n be an integer, and 1 ≤ k < n with gcd(k, n) = 1.
Let 1 ≤ k < n be the multiplicative inverse of k modulo n, i.e., k k ≡ 1 mod n.
Then for any a ∈ F * 2 n , x 2 k +1 + x + a = 0 has only one solution in F 2 n if and only if T r(R k,k (1/a)) = T r(1) + 1, where R k,k (·) is defined by (1).
a ∈ F * 2 n , R k,k (1/a) is a zero of ax 2 k +1 + k i=1 x 2 ik + k + 1 = 0(3)anda 2 k x 2 2k + x 2 k + ax + 1 = 0 in F * 2 n .
Lemma 4 Let n be an integer, and 1 ≤ k < n with gcd(k, Lemma 5 Let n be an integer, and 1 ≤ k < n with gcd(k, n) = d. For any a ∈ F * 2 n , if x 2 k +1 + x+ a = 0 has two solutions, and β is one of the solutions, then ax 2 k + β 2 x + β = 0 has one solution in F 2 n .
n) = d. For any a ∈ F * 2 n , if x 2 k +1 + x+ a = 0 has only one solution β, then ax 2 k + β 2 x + β = 0 has no solution in F 2 n .
Moreover, x 2 k −1 + β 2 k −1 + 1/β = 0 has no solution.
By the same proof as in Lemma 4, we have ax 2 k + β 2 x + β = 0 has one solution.
Ifx 2 k −1 + β 2 k −1 + 1/β = 0 has one solution, then this solution is nonzero.
Hence ax 2 k + β 2 x = 0has one nonzero solution, and ax 2 k + β 2 x + β = 0 has two solutions.
It is a contradiction.
Hencex 2 k −1 + β 2 k −1 + 1/β = 0 has no solution.Lemma 6 Let n be an integer, and 1 ≤ k < n with gcd(k, n) = d. For any a ∈ F * 2 n , if x 2 k +1 + x+ a = 0 has 2 d + 1 solutions, and β is one of the solutions, then ax 2 k + β 2 x + β = 0 has 2 d solutions in F 2 n .
Moreover,x 2 k −1 + β 2 k −1 + 1/β = 0 has 2 d − 1 solutions.Proof.
By the same proof as in Lemma 4, we have ax 2 k + β 2 x + β = 0 has 2 d solutions.
Hence ax 2 k + β 2 x = 0 has 2 d solutions.
It follows that x 2 k −1 + β 2 k −1 + 1/β = 0 has 2 d − 1 solutions.Lemma 7 Let n be an integer, and 1 ≤ k < n with gcd(k, n) = d and n/d is odd.
For any λ ∈ F * 2 n , setL λ (ω) = ω 2 2k + λ 2 k ω 2 k + ω + λ 2 k−1 ,and P λ (ω) = ω 2 k +1 + ω + 1λ 2 k−1 + 1 2 .
Then we have the following 4 cases:• if P λ (ω) = 0 has no solution in F 2 n , then L λ (ω) = 0 has at most one solution in F 2 n .
In particular, if n is odd, and gcd(n,k) = 1, then L λ (ω) = 0 has precisely one solution ω 0 = R k,k (λ 2 k−1 + 1 2 )/ √ λ,and T r(ω 2 k +1 0 ) = 1.
• if P λ (ω) = 0 has one solution in F 2 n , then L λ (ω) = 0 has 0 or 2 d solutions in F 2 n , and ω:L λ (ω)=0 (−1) T r(ω 2 k +1 ) = 0.
In particular, if n is odd, and gcd(n, k) = 1, then L λ (ω) = 0 has precisely two solutions.
• if P λ (ω) = 0 has two solutions in F 2 n , then L λ (ω) = 0 has one solution ω 0 in F 2 n , andT r(ω 2 k +1 0 ) = 0.
• if P λ (ω) = 0 has 2 d + 1 solutions in F 2 n , then L λ (ω) = 0 has 2 2d solutions in F 2 n , andω:L λ (ω)=0 (−1) T r(ω 2 k +1 ) = 2 d .
Proof.
Let x = ω √ λ, and a = 1 λ 2 k−1 +1/2 .
Then L λ (ω) = 0 if and only ifH a (x) = a 2 k x 2 2k + x 2 k + ax + 1 = 0.
(4)Let f (x) = (ax 2 k −1 ) 2 n−1 .
Then we haveH a (x) + 1 = (f (x) 2 k +1 + f (x) + a) 2 x a .
(5)By Lemma 1, there are 4 cases for the solutions of P λ (ω) = 0 in F 2 n .
Case 1: P λ (ω) = 0 has no solution in F 2 n .
Then a = β 2 k +1 +β for any β ∈ F 2 n .
By (5), H a (x)+1 = 0 has one solution.
Hence (4) has 0 or 1 solution.
In particular, if n is odd, and gcd(n, k) = 1, by Lemma 3, (4) has precisely one solution x 0 = R k,k (1/a).
It follows that L λ (ω) = 0 has precisely one solutionω 0 = R k,k (1/a)/ √ λ.
By Lemma 2, T r(R k,k (1/a)) = 1 because x 2 k +1 + x + a = 0 has no solution in F 2 n .
Hence, we have ω 2 k +1 0 = (x 0 / √ λ) 2 k +1 = ax 2 k +1 0 = k i=1 x 2 ik 0 + k + 1.
It follows thatT r(ω 2 k +1 0 ) = T r   k i=1 x 2 ik 0   + k + 1 = k · T r(x 0 ) + k + 1 = 1.
Case 2: P λ (ω) = 0 has one solution in F 2 n .
Then there is one β ∈ F 2 n such that a = β 2 k +1 + β.
Set by ω θ .
It follows thatQ(x) = ax 2 k + β 2 x + β, Γ = β 2 k −1 + 1/β.
Then we have H a (x) = Q(x) 2 k + ΓQ(x) = Q(x)(Q(x) 2 k −1 + Γ).
T r(ω 2 k +1 0 + ω 2 k +1 θ ) = T r(ax 2 k +1 0 + ax 2 k +1 θ ) = T r(β 2 x 2 0 + βx 0 + x 0 /∆ + β 2 x 2 θ + βx θ + x θ /∆) = T r(θ) = n d · T r d 1 (θ) = T r d 1 (θ).
Hence we havex θ :Q(x θ )+1/∆=0 (−1) T r(ω 2 k +1 θ ) = 0which means thatx θ :Ha(x θ )=0 (−1) T r(ω 2 k +1 θ ) = 0.
In particular, if n is odd, and gcd(n, k) = 1, by Lemma 3, R k,k (1/a) is a zero of (4).
Hence, twosolutions of Q(x) + 1/∆ = 0 are precisely R k,k (1/a) and R k,k (1/a) + ∆.
It follows that R k,k (1/a)/ √ λ and (R k,k (1/a) + ∆)/ √ λ are precisely two solutions of L λ (ω) = 0.
Case 3: P λ (ω) = 0 has two solutions in F 2 n .
Let β be one of the solutions.
Set Q(x) = ax 2 k +β 2 x+β,Γ = β 2 k −1 + 1/β.
Then we have H a (x) = Q(x) 2 k + ΓQ(x) = Q(x)(Q(x) 2 k −1 + Γ).
By Lemma 5, Q(x) = 0 has one solution, and Q(x) 2 k −1 + Γ = 0 has no solution.
Let x 0 be the onlysolution of H a (x) = 0.
Then ω 0 = x 0 / √ λ is the only solution of L λ (ω) = 0.
We have T r(ω 2 k +1 0 ) = T r(ax 2 k +1 0 ) = T r(β 2 x 2 0 + βx 0 ) = 0.
Hence x0:Ha(x0)=0 (−1) T r(ω 2 k +1 0 ) = 1.
Case 4: P λ (ω) = 0 has 2 d + 1 solutions in F 2 n .
By Lemma 6, for any β satisfying β 2 k +1 + β + a = 0,x 2 k −1 + β 2 k −1 + 1/β = 0 has 2 d − 1 solutions.
Hence, (ax 2 k −1 ) 2 n−1 = β has 2 d − 1 solutions.
By (5), H a (x) + 1 = 0 has 2 2d solutions.
Thus, (4) has 0 or 2 2d solutions.
Set Q(x) = ax 2 k + β 2 x + β, Γ = β 2 k −1 + 1/β.
Similarly, we haveH a (x) = Q(x) 2 k + ΓQ(x) = Q(x)(Q(x) 2 k −1 + Γ).
By Lemma 6, Q(x) = 0 has 2 d solutions.
So (4) has 2 2d solutions, and for any ∆ satisfying ∆ 2 k −1 = 1/Γ, Q(x) + 1/∆ = 0 has 2 d solutions.
Let x 0 be one solution of Q(x) = 0, and ω 0 be the corresponding solution of L λ (ω) = 0.
We haveT r(ω 2 k +1 0 ) = T r(ax 2 k +1 0 ) = T r(β 2 x 2 0 + βx 0 ) = 0.
By the same method as in Case 2, for any ∆, we havex0:Q(x0)+1/∆=0 (−1) T r(ω 2 k +1 0 ) = 0.
Hence ω:L λ (ω)=0 (−1) T r(ω 2 k +1 ) = x0:Ha(x0)=0 (−1) T r(ω 2 k +1 0 ) = x0:Q(x0)=0 (−1) T r(ω 2 k +1 0 ) + ∆:∆ 2 k −1 =1/Γ x0:Q(x0)+1/∆=0 (−1) T r(ω 2 k +1 0 ) = 2 d .
Lemma 8 Let f (x) = T r(x), and two integers 0 < v, t < 2 n − 1 satisfy gcd(vt, q − 1) = 1.
Then we have λ∈F 2 n f (v, t)(λ) = 0 andλ∈F 2 n f (v, t)(λ) 2 = 2 3n .
Proof.
We computeλ∈F 2 n f (v, t)(λ) = λ∈F 2 n x,y∈F 2 n (−1) T r(λy+y t x+x v ) = x,y∈F 2 n (−1) T r(y t x+x v ) λ∈F 2 n (−1) T r(λy) = 2 n x∈F 2 n (−1) T r(x v ) = 0 and λ∈F 2 n f (v, t)(λ) 2 = λ∈F 2 n x1,y1∈F 2 n (−1) T r(λy1+y t 1 x1+x v 1 ) x1,y2∈F 2 n (−1) T r(λy2+y t 2 x2+x v 2 ) = x1,x2,y1,y2∈F 2 n (−1) T r(y t 1 x1+x v 1 +y t 2 x2+x v 2 ) λ∈F 2 n (−1) T r(λy1+λy2) = 2 n x1,x2,y1∈F 2 n (−1) T r(y t 1 x1+y t 1 x2+x v 1 +x v 2 ) = 2 3n .
Lemma 9 Let n be an integer, and 1 ≤ k < n with gcd(k, n) = d. Thengcd(2 n − 1, 2 k + 1) = 1, if n/d is odd, 2 d + 1, otherwise.Proof.
One can check the result easily.
So we omit the detail here.Lemma 10 Let n be an integer, and 1 ≤ k < n with gcd(k, n) = d and n/d is odd.
Let v = 2 n−1 − 1, and t = 2 k + 1.
Then for any λ ∈ F * 2 n , we have x,y∈F 2 n (−1) T r(λy+y t x+x v ) = −2 n , 0, 2 n , or 2 n+d .
Proof.
By Lemma 9, gcd(2 n − 1, 2 k + 1) = 1.
Hence we havex,y∈F 2 n (−1) T r(λy+y t x+x v ) = x∈F * 2 n ,y∈F 2 n (−1) T r(λy+y t x+x v ) = x∈F * 2 n ,y∈F 2 n (−1) T r(λy+y t x+1/x) = x∈F * 2 n ,y∈F 2 n (−1) T r(λy+y t /x+x) = x1∈F * 2 n ,y∈F 2 n (−1) T r(λy+(y/x1) t +x t 1 ) = x1∈F * 2 n ,z∈F 2 n (−1) T r(λzx1+z t +x t 1 ) = x1,z∈F 2 n (−1) T r(z t +x t 1 +λzx1) .
Set y = x + ω.
Then we havex,y∈F 2 n (−1) T r(x 2 k +1 +y 2 k +1 +λxy) = x,ω∈F 2 n (−1) T r(x 2 k +1 +(x+ω) 2 k +1 +λx(x+ω)) = x,ω∈F 2 n (−1) T r(ω 2 k +1 +ω 2 k x+ωx 2 k +λx 2 +λωx) = x,ω∈F 2 n (−1) T r(ω 2 k +1 +(ω 2 2k +λ 2 k ω 2 k +ω+λ 2 k−1 )x 2 k ) .
Set L λ (ω) = ω 2 2k + λ 2 k ω 2 k + ω + λ 2 k−1 .
It follows that x,y∈F 2 n (−1) T r(x 2 k +1 +y 2 k +1 +λxy) = 2 n ω:L λ (ω)=0 (−1) T r(ω 2 k +1 ) .
By Lemma 7, the result follows.Lemma 11 Let n be an integer, and 1 ≤ k < n with gcd(k, n) = d and n/d is odd.
Let f (x) = T r(x), v = 2 n−1 − 1, and t = 2 k + 1.
For any η ∈ {−1, 0, 1, 2 d }, let N η denote the number of η taken by f (v, t)(λ)/2 n with λ ∈ F * 2 n .
Set m = n/d.
Then we haveN −1 = 2 (m+1)d + 2 d 2(2 d + 1) , N 0 = 2 (m−1)d − 1, N 1 = (2 d − 2)(2 md − 1) 2(2 d − 1) , N 2 d = 2 (m−1)d − 1 2 2d − 1 .
Proof.
If d = 1, then the result follows from Lemmas 1, 7 and 10 directly.
So we only need to prove the case of d > 1.
Let P λ (ω) and L λ (ω) be defined as in Lemma 7.
By Lemmas 1, 7 and 10,N 2 d = 2 (m−1)d −1 2 2d −1 .
Let M 0,0denote the number of λ ∈ F * 2 n such that P λ (ω) = 0 has no solution, and L λ (ω) = 0 has no solution.
For any σ ∈ {−1, 1}, let M 0,σ denote the number of λ ∈ F * 2 n such that P λ (ω) = 0 has no solution, andL λ (ω) = 0 has one solution ω 0 satisfying (−1) T r(ω 2 k +1 0 ) = σ.By Lemmas 1, 7 and 10, we haveM 0,−1 + M 0,0 + M 0,1 = 2 (m+1)d + 2 d 2(2 d + 1) , M 0,−1 = N −1 , M 0,0 + 2 (m−1)d − 1 = N 0 , M 0,1 + (2 d − 2)(2 md − 1) 2(2 d − 1) = N 1 .
Because f (v, t)(0) = 2 n , by Lemma 8, we have−M 0,−1 + M 0,1 + (2 d − 2)(2 md − 1) 2(2 d − 1) + 2 d · 2 (m−1)d − 1 2 2d − 1 = −1.
Hence M 0,−1 − M 0,1 = 2 (m+1)d + 2 d 2(2 d + 1)which means that M 0,0 + 2M 0,1 = 0.
Thus, M 0,0 = 0, and M 0,1 = 0.
It follows thatN −1 = 2 (m+1)d + 2 d 2(2 d + 1) , N 0 = 2 (m−1)d − 1, N 1 = (2 d − 2)(2 md − 1) 2(2 d − 1) .
Remark 4 With the same notation as in Lemma 7, we obtain better result in Lemma 11 implicitly compared with that in Lemma 7, namely,• if P λ (ω) = 0 has no solution in F 2 n , then L λ (ω) = 0 has precisely one solution ω 0 in F 2 n , andT r(ω 2 k +1 0 ) = 1.
Proof of Theorem 2.
By Theorem 1 and Lemma 11, the result follows.Compared with the binary case proved by Dillon and Dobbertin in 2004, we have Table 3 below.Note that 2 n−1 − 1 and −1 are in the same coset modulo 2 n − 1.
The new ternary or quaternary sequences yield new Hadamard matrixes with entries in {−1, 0, 2}or {−1, 0, 1, 2 d }.
For any binary sequence {s i } with two-level autocorrelation of period 2 n − 1, using the standard construction from binary two-level autocorrelation sequences to Hadamard matrices, letA =          1 1 1 · · · 1 1 1 s 0 s 1 · · · s 2 n −3 s 2 n −2 1 s 1 s 2 · · · s 2 n −2 s 0 . . . 1 s 2 n −2 s 0 · · · s 2 n −4 s 2 n −3          .
Then AA T = 2 n · I 2 n ,where A T is the transpose of A and I 2 n is the identity matrix of 2 n × 2 n .
Similarly, we have new 2 n × 2 n Hadamard matrixes with entries in {−1, 0, 2} or {−1, 0, 1, 2 d }.
Example.
Let n = 5, v = 15, and t = 3.
Then one sequence s of period 31 defined by (2) Pseudorandom sequences with two-level autocorrelation are very useful in communications and cryptography.
The search of new sequences with two-level autocorrelation is a very interesting problem.
