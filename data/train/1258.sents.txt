We study the link structure of on-line social networks (OSNs), and introduce a new model for such networks which may help infer their hidden underlying reality.
In the geo-protean (GEO-P) model for OSNs nodes are identified with points in Euclidean space, and edges are stochastically generated by a mixture of the relative distance of nodes and a ranking function.
With high probability , the GEO-P model generates graphs satisfying many observed properties of OSNs, such as power law degree distributions, the small world property, densifica-tion power law, and bad spectral expansion.
We introduce the dimension of an OSN based on our model, and examine this new parameter using actual OSN data.
We discuss how the dimension parameter of an OSN may eventually be used as a tool to group users with similar attributes using only the link structure of the network.
On-line social networking sites such as Facebook, Flickr, LinkedIn, MySpace, and Twitter are examples of largescale, complex, real-world networks, with an estimated total number of users that equals half of all Internet users [2].
We may model an OSN by a graph with nodes representing users and edges corresponding to friendship links.
While OSNs gain increasing popularity among the general public, there is a parallel increase in interest in the cataloguing and modelling of their structure, function, and evolution.
OSNs supply a vast and historically unprecedented record of large-scale human social interactions over time.The availability of large-scale social network data has led to numerous studies that revealed emergent topologi-cal properties of OSNs.
The next challenge is the design and rigorous analysis of models simulating these properties.
Graph models were successful in simulating properties of other complex networks like the web graph (see the books [4,7] for surveys of such models), and it is thus natural to propose models for OSNs.
Few rigorous models for OSNs have been posed and analyzed, and there is no universal consensus of which properties such models should simulate.
Notable recent models are those of Kumar et al. [17], which focused on simulating the component structure of OSNs, and the ILT model [5] based on transitivity properties of social networks.Researchers are now in the enviable position of observing how OSNs evolve over time, and as such, network analysis and models of OSNs typically incorporate time as a parameter.
While by no means exhaustive, some of the main observed properties of OSNs include the following.
(i) Large-scale.
OSNs are examples of complex networks with number nodes (which we write as n) often in the millions; further, some users have disproportionately high degrees.
For example, each of the nodes of Twitter corresponding to celebrities Ashton Kutcher, Ellen Degeneres, and Britney Spears have degree over four million [25].
(ii) Small world property.
The small world property, introduced by Watts and Strogatz [26], is a central notion in the study of complex networks, and has roots in the work of the Milgram [22] on short paths of friends connecting strangers in the United States (see also [15]).
The small world property demands a low diameter of O(log n), and a higher clustering coefficient than found in a binomial random graph with the same number of nodes and same average degree.
Adamic et al. [1] provided an early study of an OSN at Stanford University, and found that the network has the small world property.
Similar results were found in [2] which studied Cyworld, MySpace, and Orkut, and in [23] which examined data collected from Flickr, YouTube, LiveJournal, and Orkut.In the latter study, the average distances and clustering coefficients of the OSNs were found to be lower and higher, respectively, than those of the web graph.
Low diameter (of 6) and high clustering coefficient were reported in the Twitter by Java et al. [14] (see also [16]).
(iii) Power law degree distributions.
In a graph G of order n, let N k be the number of nodes of degree k.
The degree distribution of G follows a power law if N k is proportional to k −b , for a fixed exponent b > 2.
Power laws were observed over a decade ago in subgraphs sampled from the web graph, and are ubiquitous properties of complex networks (see Chapter 2 of [4]).
Kumar, Novak, and Tomkins [17] studied the evolution of Flickr and Yahoo!360, and found that these networks exhibit power-law degree distributions.
Golder et al. [11] discovered a power law degree distribution in the Facebook network.
Power law degree distributions for both the in-and out-degree distributions were documented in Flickr, YouTube, LiveJournal, and Orkut [23], as well as in Twitter [14].
(iv) Shrinking distances.
Kumar et al. [17] reported that in Flickr and Yahoo!360 the diameter actually decreases over time.
Similar results were reported for Cyworld in [2].
Well-known models for complex networks such as preferential attachment or copying models have logarithmically growing diameters with time.
Various models (see [18,19]) were proposed simulating power law degree distributions and decreasing distances.
(v) Bad spectral expansion.
Social networks often organize into separate clusters in which the intra-cluster links are significantly higher than the number of intercluster links.
In particular, social networks contain communities (characteristic of social organization), where tightly knit groups correspond to the clusters [24].
As a result, it is reported in [9] that social networks, unlike other complex networks, possess bad spectral expansion properties realized by small gaps between the first and second eigenvalues of their adjacency matrices.Our main contributions in the present work are to provide a model-the geo-protean (GEO-P) model-which simulates all five properties above (see Section 3), and to suggest a reverse engineering approach to OSNs.
Given only the link structure of OSNs, we ask whether it is possible to infer the hidden reality of such networks.
Can we group users with similar attributes from only the link structure?
For instance, a reasonable assumption is that out of the millions of users on a typical OSN, if we could assign the users various attributes such as age, sex, religion, geography, and so on, then we should be able to identify individuals or at least small sets of users by their set of attributes.
Thus, if we can infer a set of identifying attributes for each node from the link structure, then we can use this information to recognize communities and understand connections between users.Characterizing users by a set of attributes leads naturally to a vector-based or geometric approach to OSNs.
In geometric graph models, nodes are identified with points in a metric space, and edges are introduced by probabilistic rules that depend on the proximity of the nodes in the space.
We envision OSNs as embedded in a social space, whose dimensions quantify user traits such as interests or geography; for instance, nodes representing users from the same city or in the same profession would likely be closer in social space.
A first step in this direction was given in [20], which introduced a rankbased geometric model for social networks.
Such an approach was taken in the SPA geometric model for the web graph; see [3].
In [13] it is shown how a theoretical analysis of the SPA model leads to a highly accurate measure for the estimated spatial distance between nodes, based on the number of common neighbours.The geo-protean model incorporates a geometric view of OSNs, and also exploits ranking to determine the link structure.
Higher ranked nodes are more likely to receive links.
A formal description of the model is given in Section 2.
Results on the model are summarized in Section 3.
We present a novel approach to OSNs by assigning them a dimension; see the formula (4).
Given certain OSN statistics (order, power law exponent, average degree, and diameter), we can assign each OSN a dimension based on our model.
In a certain sense, the dimension of an OSN is the least integer m such that we can accurately embed the OSN in m-dimensional Euclidean space.
A suggestive (although unproven) interpretation of the dimension is that it equals the least number of attributes needed to identify individuals or small sets of users.
A sketch of proofs of our results are presented in Section 4.
We conclude with a discussion of our findings, and present an outline of future work.
We now present our model for OSNs, which is based on both the notions of embedding the nodes in a metric space (geometric), and a link probability based on a ranking of the nodes (protean).
We identify the users of an OSN with points in m-dimensional Euclidean space.
Each node has a region of influence, and nodes may be joined with a certain probability if they land within each others region of influence.
Nodes are ranked by their popularity from 1 to n, where n is the number of nodes, and 1 is the highest ranked node.
Nodes that are ranked higher have larger regions of influence, and so are more likely to acquire links over time.
For simplicity, we consider only undirected graphs.
The number of nodes n is fixed but the model is dynamic: at each time-step, a node is born and one dies.
A static number of nodes is more representative of the reality of OSNs, as the number of users in an OSN would typically have a maximum (an absolute maximum arises from roughly the number of users on the internet, not counting multiple accounts).
For a discussion of ranking models for complex networks, see [10,12,21].
We now formally define the GEO-P model.
The model produces a sequence (G t : t ≥ 0) of undirected graphs on n nodes, where t denotes time.
We write G t = (V t , E t ).
There are four parameters: the attachment strength α ∈ (0, 1), the density parameter β ∈ (0, 1−α), the dimension m ∈ N, and the link probability p ∈ (0, 1].
Each node v ∈ V t has rank r(v, t) ∈ [n] (we use [n] to denote the set {1, 2, . . . , n}).
The rank function r(·, t) : V t → [n] is a bijection for all t, so every node has a unique rank.
The highest ranked node has rank equal to 1; the lowest ranked node has rank n.
The initialization and update of the ranking is done by random initial rank.
In particular, the node added at time t obtains an initial rank R t which is randomly chosen from [n] according to a prescribed distribution.
Ranks of all nodes are adjusted accordingly.
Formally, for each v ∈ V t−1 , r(v, t) = r(v, t − 1) + δ − γ, where δ = 1 if r(v, t − 1) > R t and 0 otherwise, and γ = 1 if the rank of the node deleted in step t is smaller than r(v, t − 1), and 0 otherwise.Let S be the unit hypercube in R m , with the torus metric d(·, ·) derived from the L ∞ metric.
In particular, for any two points x and y in R m ,d(x, y) = min{||x − y + u|| ∞ : u ∈ {−1, 0, 1} m }.
The torus metric thus "wraps around" the boundaries of the unit cube, so every point in S is equivalent.
The torus metric is chosen so that there are no boundary effects, and altering the metric will not significantly affect the main results.To initialize the model, let G 0 = (V 0 , E 0 ) be any graph on n nodes that are chosen from S.
We define the influence region of node v at time t ≥ 0, written R(v, t), to be the ball around v with volume|R(v, t)| = r(v, t) −α n −β .
For t ≥ 1, we form G t from G t−1 according to the following rules.
(i) Add a new node v that is chosen uniformly at random from S. Next, independently, for each node u ∈ V t−1 such that v ∈ R(u, t − 1), an edge vu is created with probability p. Note that the probability that u receives an edge is proportional to p r(u, t − 1) −α .
The negative exponent guarantees that nodes with higher ranks (r(u, t − 1) close to 1) are more likely to receive new edges than lower ranks.
(ii) Choose uniformly at random a node u ∈ V t−1 , delete u and all edges incident to u.(iii) Update the ranking function r(·, t) :V t → [n].
Since the process is an ergodic Markov chain, it will converge to a stationary distribution.
The random graph corresponding to this distribution with given parameters α, β, m, p is called the geo-protean (or GEO-P model) graph, and is written GEO-P(α, β, m, p).
See Figure 1 for a simulation of the model in the unit square.
We now state the main theoretical results on the geoprotean model.
The model generates with high probability graphs satisfying each of the properties (i) to (v) in the introduction.
Proofs are sketched (or omitted due to lack of space) in Section 4; complete proofs will appear in the full version.
Throughout, we will use the stronger notion of wep in favour of the more commonly used aas, since it simplifies some of our proofs.
We say that an event holds with extreme probability (wep), if it holds with probability at least 1 − exp(−Θ(log 2 n)) as n → ∞.
Thus, if we consider a polynomial number of events that each holds wep, then wep all events hold.Let N k = N k (n, p, α, β) denote the number of nodes of degree k, and N ≥k = l≥k N l .
The following theorem demonstrates that the geo-protean model generates power law graphs with exponentb = 1 + 1/α.
(1)Note that the variables N ≥k represent the cumulative degree distribution, so the degree distribution has power law exponent 1/α.
Theorem 3.1.
Let α ∈ (0, 1), β ∈ (0, 1 − α), m ∈ N, p ∈ (0, 1], and n 1−α−β log 1/2 n ≤ k ≤ n 1−α/2−β log −2α−1 n.Then wep GEO-P(α, β, m, p) satisfiesN ≥k = 1 + O(log −1/3 n) α α + 1 p 1/α n (1−β)/α k −1/α .
For a graph G of order n, define the average degree ofG by d = 2|E|n .
Our next results shows that geo-protean graphs are dense.
Wep the average degree of GEO-P(α, β, m, p) isd = (1 + o(1)) p 1 − α n 1−α−β .
(2)Note that the average degree tends to infinity with n; that is, the model generates graphs satisfying a densification power law.
In [18], densification power laws were reported in several real-world networks such as the physics citation graph and the internet graph at the level of autonomous systems.Our next result describes the diameter of graphs sampled from the GEO-P model.
While the diameter is not shrinking, it can be made constant by allowing the dimension to grow as a function of n.
We note that in a geometric model where regions of influence have constant volume and possessing the same average degree as the geo-protean model, the diameter is Θ(n α+β m ).
This is a larger diameter than in the GEO-P model.
If m = C log n, for some constant C > 0, then wep we obtain a diameter bounded by a constant.
We can also prove (and will be presented in the full version) that wep the GEO-P model generates graph with constant clustering coefficient.The normalized Laplacian of a graph, introduced by Chung [6], relates to important graph properties.
Let A denote the adjacency matrix and D denote the diagonal degree matrix of a graph G.
Then the normalized Laplacian of G isL = I − D −1/2 AD −1/2 .
Let 0 = λ 0 ≤ λ 1 ≤ · · · ≤ λ n−1 ≤ 2 denote the eigenvalues of L.The spectral gap of the normalized Laplacian is λ = max{|λ 1 − 1|, |λ n−1 − 1|}.
A small spectral gap is an indication of bad expansion properties, which are characteristic of OSNs (see property (v) in the introduction).
The following theorem suggests a significantly smaller spectral difference between graphs generated by our model than in random graphs.Theorem 3.4.
Let α ∈ (0, 1), β ∈ (0, 1 − α), m ∈ N, and p ∈ (0, 1].
Let λ(n) be the spectral gap of the normalized Laplacian of GEO-P(α, β, m, p).
Then wep (i) If m = m(n) = o(log n), then λ(n) = 1 + o(1).
(ii) If m = m(n) = C log n for some C > 0, thenλ(n) ≥ 1 − exp − α + β C .
Theorem 3.4 represents a drastic departure from the good expansion found in random graphs, where λ = o(1) [6,7].
Given an OSN, we describe how we may find the corresponding dimension parameter m if we assume the GEO-P model.
In particular, if we know the order n, power law exponent b, average degree d, and diameter D of an OSN, then we can calculate m using the formulas (1), (2), and (3).
The formula for m then (ignoring constants in the O(·) and Ω(·) notation) becomesm = log n 2d ( b−1 b−2 ) log D(4)Note that (4) suggests a logarithmic growth for the dimension m depending on n.The parameters b, d, and D have been determined for samples from OSNs in various studies such as [2,23,14].
The following chart summarizes this data and gives the dimension for each network, with citations (next to the name of the network) where the data was taken.
We round m up to the nearest integer.
Owing to the largescale character of these networks, our assumption is that the parameters b, d, D found in those samples approximate the ones in the entire network.
We note that the estimates of the number of users n for Flickr and Twitter come from Wikipedia [27], those from YouTube comes from their website [28], and those of Cyworld are from [8].
When the data consisted of directed graphs, we took b to be the power law exponent for the in-degree distribution.
As noted in [2], the power law exponent of b = 5 for Cyworld holds only for users whose degree is at most approximately 100.
Owing to space constraints, we only give sketches of the proofs of the degree distribution and diameter results of Section 3.
Complete proofs of all the results will appear in the full version of the paper.
The following theorem (whose proof is omitted) shows how the degree of a given node depends on the age rank; that is, the bijection a(·, t) :V t → [n]where nodes are ranked by age (the oldest node has rank equal to 1, and the youngest one has rank n).
Theorem 4.1.
Let α ∈ (0, 1), β ∈ (0, 1 − α), m ∈ N, p ∈ (0, 1], i = i(n) ∈ [n].
Let v i be the node in GEO-P(α, β, m, p) whose age rank at time L equals a(v i , L) = i, and let R i be the initial rank ofv i .
If R i ≥ √ n log 2 n, then wep deg(vi,L)=(1+O(log −1/2 n))p i (1−α)n +( R i n ) −α n−i n n 1−α−β .
Otherwise, that is, if R i < √ n log 2 n, wepdeg(vi,L) ≥ (1+O(log −1/2 n)) p( i (1−α)n +n α/2 log −2α n n−i n ) ×n 1−α−β .
Theorem 4.1 implies that wep the minimum degree is (1 + o(1))pn 1−α−β .
Moreover, the average degree isd = (1 + o(1)) 2 n n i=1 p 1 − α i − 1 n − 1 n 1−α−β = (1 + o(1)) p 1 − α n 1−α−β .
Hence, the proof of Theorem 3.2 follows.Proof of Theorem 3.1.
By Theorem 4.1 it follows that wep each node v i that has the initial rank R i ≥ √ n log 2 n such thatR i n ≥ 1 + log −1/3 n pn 1−α−β n − i n k −1 1/αhas fewer than k neighbours, and each node v i for whichR i n ≤ 1 − log −1/3 n pn 1−α−β n − i n k −1 1/αhas more than k neighbours.
Let i 0 be the largest value of i such thatpn 1−α−β n − i n k −1 1/α ≥ 2 log 2 n √ n .
(Note that i 0 = n − O(n/ log n), since k ≤ n 1−α/2−β log −2α−1 n.) Thus,EN ≥k = i 0 i=1 1+O(log −1/3 n) (pn 1−α−β n−i n k −1 ) 1/α +O n i=i 0 +1 log 2 n √ n = 1+O(log −1/3 n) (pn −α−β k −1 ) 1/α n i=1 (n−i) 1/α = 1+O(log −1/3 n) (pn −α−β k −1 ) 1/α n 1+1/α 1+1/α = 1+O(log −1/3 n) α α+1 p 1/α n (1−β)/α k −1/α .
and the assertion follows from the Chernoff bound, since k ≤ n 1−α/2−β log −2α−1 n and soEN ≥k = Ω( √ n log 2+1/α n).
We now consider the diameter of graphs generated by the GEO-P model.
We partition the hypercube into 1/A hypercubes, each of volume A (with A to be determined later).
Consider nodes with initial rank at most R and age at most n/2 (again, R to be determined later).
In each small hypercube, we would like to have log 2 n such nodes whose initial influence region contains the whole hypercube in which the node is located, and also all neighbouring hypercubes.It can be shown that wep this is the case and remains so to the end of the process, if the initial influence region is slightly larger than 4 m A; say, at least 5 m A. Therefore, we obtain thatR −α n −β = 5 m A.(5)It follows from the Chernoff bound that wep every small hypercube contains log 2 n such nodes, provided that the expected number is at least, say, 2 log 2 n. Hence, we require that n 2 A R n = 2 log 2 n.Combining (5) and (6) we obtain that the number of hypercubes is equal to1 A = 5 m+α 1−α n β 1−α log 2α 1−α n.Now, since wep there are log 2 n nodes in each hypercube to choose from, wep we can select exactly one node from each hypercube so that each node is adjacent to the chosen nodes from all neighbouring hypercubes (the younger node falls into the region of influence of the older neighbours, and creates an edge with probability p).
Let us call this subgraph the backbone.
It is clear that the diameter of the backbone is To finish the proof, we will show that wep any node v that is not in the backbone is within distance two from some node in the backbone.
Since wep the minimum degree is Ω(n 1−α−β ), wep Ω(n 1−α−β ) neighbours of v have age rank at least n/2.
Since each such neighbour falls into the region of influence of some node in the backbone, wep at least one neighbour of v must be connected the backbone.
We introduced the geo-protean (GEO-P) geometric model for OSNs, and showed that with high probability, the model generates graphs satisfying each of the properties (i) to (v) in the introduction.
We introduce the dimension of an OSN based on our model, and examine this new parameter using actual OSN data.
We observed that the dimension of various OSNs ranges from four to 7.
It may therefore, be possible to group users via a relatively small number of attributes, although this remains unproven.The ideas of using geometry and dimension to explore OSNs is a novel one, and deserves to be more thoroughly investigated.
It would be interesting to explore how best to fit OSNs into Euclidean space, with an emphasis on the accuracy of the embedding.
Our hope is that a geometric structure exhibited by social networks may be used to further explore properties of the network.
Can a geometric embedding of OSNs help determine their community structure?
Another direction is to examine the edge-length distribution in the GEO-P model, and then apply that to actual OSN to classify "long" links in social networks.
