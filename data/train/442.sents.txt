We introduce a new problem in the study of doubling spaces: Given a point set S and a target dimension d * , remove from S the fewest number of points so that the remaining set has doubling dimension at most d *.
We present a bicriteria approximation for this problem, and extend this algorithm to solve a group of proximity problems.
In the last few years, researchers have increasingly made use of the doubling dimension in the design of algorithms.
Analyzing algorithmic tasks via the doubling dimension is natural for proximity problems such as nearest neighbor search [KL04, BKL06, CG06b] and clustering [Tal04, ABS08, FM10], and for graph problems such as spanner construction [GGN06, CG06a, DPP06, GR08a, GR08b], the traveling salesman problem [Tal04], and routing [KSW04, Sli05, AGGM06, KRXY07, KRX08].
The doubling dimension has proved to be a powerful tool in embeddings [Ass83, GKL03, ABN07, ABN08, CGT08, BRS07, GK09] and has found applications in fields such as machine learning [BLL09, GKK10].
Interestingly, the problem of computing the exact doubling dimension of a point set is NP-hard.
(This result seems to be folklore.)
Yet this fact has not deterred the development of algorithms that are based on the doubling dimension, partly because it can be approximated within a constant factor, and partly because many of these algorithms function without explicit knowledge of the doubling dimension -it appears only in the analysis.However, a host of algorithms previously developed for doubling dimension -perhaps even the majority of them -suffer from a more serious problem: They are not robust to severe yet infrequent irregularities in the space.
The guarantees provided by these algorithms are markedly degraded even if only a small subset of the working set possesses high doubling dimension.
This problem was noted for example by [CG08] who instead defined a global notion of dimension (which can be thought of as the average doubling dimension over the set) and developed an algorithm under this new definition.We pursue a different approach.
We introduce the following key problem: Given an n-point set S and a target dimension d * , remove from S the fewest number of points so that the remaining set has doubling dimension at most d * (or equivalently, target doubling constant λ * = 2 d * ).
We thus call a data set nearly-doubling if all but a negligible fraction of the points have bounded doubling dimension.A solution to this point removal problem yields a contribution in two related areas.
The first paradigm, broadly speaking, is outlier detection.
In this scenario, the removed points are ignored and only the remaining points are processed.
A direct motivation for this model stems from the dimension induced clustering framework of [GHPT05], which given a point set seeks a subset with low intrinsic dimension.
Further motivation stems from algorithms which have "slack"; that is, they give guarantees for most but not all of the point set [KRXY07, FM10].
These algorithm can be extended to nearly-doubling data sets by simply ignoring the removed points (i.e. throwing them into the slack).
The second paradigm is an original one: Here, both the removed points and the remaining ones are processed, albeit by separate algorithms tailored to the properties of the two point sets.Results.
The point removal problem is NP-hard, and it is not difficult to show that the problem does not admit even an approximate multiplicative-factor solution (see Lemma 1).
However, we develop a framework that yields a bicriteria approximation for this problem.
In Section 3, we present bicriteria algorithms that achieve the following bounds:1.
In time 2 O(d * ) n 3 , we remove a number of points arbitrarily close to optimal, while achieving doubling dimension 4d * + O(1) (Corollary 1).
2.
In time 2 O(d * ) n log α (where α is the aspect ratio of S), we remove a number of points arbitrarily close to optimal, while achieving doubling dimension 10d * + O(1) (Corollary 2).
3.
In time 2 O(d * ) n log 3 n, we remove a number of points arbitrarily close to optimal, while achieving doubling dimension 12d * + O(1) (Corollary 2).
Returning to the first paradigm presented above, our algorithms solve the clustering problem posed by [GHPT05].
(They provided heuristic solutions to this question.)
In Section 4, we present algorithms that function under the second paradigm delineated above: These algorithms process the removed points and the remaining ones with separate techniques tailored to the properties of the two point sets.
When the data set is nearly-doubling, or more precisely, when all but at most square root of the points have bounded doubling dimension, we give near-linear time algorithms for constructing (1 + ε)-stretch spanners, approximate minimum spanning trees, O(1)-query time distance oracles, and calculating approximate all points nearest neighbor.
In this section we define doubling dimension, and present some basic hardness results.
We then review point hierarchies for doubling spaces.Doubling dimension.
For a metric (X, d), let λ be the infimum value such that every closed ball in X can be covered by λ closed balls of half the radius, where a ball is centered at a point of the metric.
λ is the doubling constant of X, and the doubling dimension of X is dim(X) = log 2 λ.
A metric is doubling when its doubling dimension is finite.
It is a folklore result that determining the doubling constant (and dimension) of a point set is an NP-hard problem.
We formalize this result below.Lemma 1.
Given a metric (S, d), computing the doubling constant of S is NPhard.Proof.
The proof is a reduction from vertex cover with bounded degree ∆ [PY91].
Let G = (V, E) be an input instance of vertex cover with degree ∆ < |V |.
Note that the size of any vertex cover of G must be greater than |V |.
Create a set S containing |V | points, each corresponding to a vertex in V .
Let d(u, v) = 1 2 for u, v ∈ S if the corresponding vertices have an edge in E, and let d(u, v) = 1 otherwise.
The radius of S is 1.
Now, any subset of S found in a closed ball of radius 1 2 contains fewer than |V | points (since the degree of V is less than |V |), so the doubling constant of the subset is less than |V |.
However, the minimum covering of all of S by closed balls of radius 1 2 is equivalent to the minimum vertex cover of V , which is necessarily greater than |V |.
It follows that determining the doubling constant of S is equivalent to determining the minimum vertex cover of V .
Note that the above reduction preserves hardness of approximation: It is NP-hard to determine the doubling constant of a metric within a factor 16 15 − ε (see [Cle99]).
This problem does admit an approximation -for example, a 2-approximation to the doubling dimension (equivalently, the square of the doubling constant) can be determined by the algorithm of Lemma 3 (see also [HM05, Theorem 9.1]).
A further consequence of Lemma 1 is that the problem of removing the minimum number of points from a set S in order to obtain a set S ′ with some target doubling constant does not admit a multiplicative-factor approximation algorithm: That is, it is NP-hard to distinguish the case where no points need be removed, from the case that one point must be removed.Point hierarchies.
Here, we define hierarchical partitions and describe three different partitions that have appeared in the literature and will be utilized in this paper.Similar to what was described in [GGN06, KL04], a subset of points X ⊆ Y is an (r, s)-discrete center set (or net in the terminology of [KL04]) of Y (r ≤ s) if it satisfies the following properties:(i) Packing: For every x, y ∈ X, d(x, y) > r.(ii) Covering: Every point y ∈ Y is strictly within distance s of some pointx ∈ X: d(x, y) ≤ s.We say that x covers y if x ∈ X, y ∈ Y and d(x, y) ≤ s.
The previous conditions require that the points of X be spaced out, yet nevertheless cover all points of Y .
A hierarchical partition for a set S is a hierarchy of discrete center sets, where each level of the hierarchy is a discrete center set of the level beneath it.
The bottom level contains all points, and the top level contains only a single point.
(For ease of presentation, we assume that the minimum inter-point distance in S is 1.)
The first hierarchy we describe is that of [KL04].
The hierarchy is composed of levels H 2 i (for integer i = 0, . . .), where each level H 2 i (i > 0) is a (2 i , 2 i )-discrete center set for the previous level H 2 i−1 .
(The subscript in the notation of the level indicates that the packing and covering properties of subsequent levels grow by a factor of 2.)
The bottom level of the hierarchy is the set Y 2 0 =1 = S, and the top level is the set Y 2 ⌈log α⌉ that contains only a single point.
The construction supports insertions and deletions to the hierarchy in time 2 O(log λ) log α.
(Recall that α is the aspect ratio of S.)The second hierarchy is that of [GR08a].
This hierarchy is similar to that of[KL04], but level H 2 i is a ( 1 2 2 i , 2 i )-discrete center set for H 2 i−1.
This hierarchy supports insertions and deletions in 2 O(log λ) log n amortized time.
Hence, a series of n insertions and deletions can be done deterministically in 2 O(log λ) n log n time.The third hierarchy is that of [CG06b].
In this hierarchy, level H 5 i is a ( 1 5 5 i , 3 5 5 i )-discrete center set for H 5 i−1 .
(The packing and covering properties of subsequent levels grow by a factor of 5.)
The hierarchy supports insertions in time 2 O(log λ) log n, though points cannot be removed from within the hierarchy.
(A static hierarchy with similar construction time was also presented in [HM06].)
On top of these hierarchies, we define a parent-child relationship: Point y ∈ H 2 i (or H 5 i ) is the child of one of the points in H 2 i+1 (or H 5 i ) that covers y.
This immediately defines an ancestral relationship as well.
In this section, we present the bicriteria algorithm for the problem of removing points to obtain a target doubling constant.
The construction, presented below, proceeds roughly as follows: We formulate the notion of a "bad" witness set, which can be found efficiently and exists if and only if the doubling constant is too large (to within some constant factors).
Given this setup, the algorithms is greedy: Repeatedly find such a witness set and remove it entirely.We first define the density constant (in Section 3.1), and explain the existence of witness sets for the density constant.
We show that it is NP-hard to locate a maximum witness set, but we are able to give an approximation algorithm for locating witness sets.
In Section 3.2, we use this approximation algorithm for witness sets to develop a bicriteria point removal algorithm for achieving a target density constant.
This bicriteria algorithm in turn yields a bicriteria point removal algorithm for achieving a target doubling constant.
Finally, in Section 3.3, we show how to improve the runtime of the two bicriteria algorithms.
Let a closed ball B(x, r) ∈ S be centered at point x and include all points of set S within distance r of x.
We define the density constant µ(S) of point set S as follows: µ(S) is the smallest number such that every open r-radius ball of S (for every r) contains at most µ(S) points of mutual inter-point distance greater than r/2.
Clearly the doubling constant cannot be greater than the density constant.
Further, the density constant is not greater than the square of the doubling constant (since µ(S) balls of radius r 4 are required to cover these points).
It follows thatµ(S) ≤ λ(S) ≤ µ(S).
Now, we consider the following point removal problem: Given a point set S and a target density constant µ * ≤ µ(S), remove the minimum number of points from S to obtain a set S * with density constant µ * .
(This problem can serve as a proxy for the problem of removing points to obtain a target doubling constant.)
However, we demonstrate in Lemma 2 below that the problem of determining the density constant of a point set S is NP-hard.
An immediate consequence of Lemma 2 is that the point removal problem to achieve a target density constant is NP-hard.
Lemma 2.
Given a point set S, the problem of determining the density constant of S is NP-hard.
Proof.
The proof is a reduction from the maximum independent set problem with bounded degree ∆ [PY91].
Let G = (V, E) be an input instance of the max independent set problem with degree ∆ < |V |.
Note that the size of any maximal independent set for G is greater than |V |.
Create a set S containing |V | points, each corresponding to a vertex in V .
Let d(u, v) = 1 2 + ε for u, v ∈ S (and an infinitely small ε) if the corresponding vertices have an edge in E, and let d(u, v) = 1 otherwise.
The radius of S is 1.
Now, any subset of S found in a closed ball of radius 1 2 +ε contains fewer than |V | points (since the degree of V is less than |V |), so the density constant of any subset of points of S that all fall in a ball of radius 1 2 +ε and have inter-point distance greater than 1 4 + ε 2 is less than |V |.
However, the maximum number of points in all of S with inter-point distance greater than 1 2 is necessarily greater than |V |.
It follows that determining the density constant of S is equivalent to determining the maximum independent set in V .
As an aside, note that the reduction preserves hardness of approximation: It is NP-hard to approximate the density constant of a point set S within a factor of |S| Definition 1.
Given a point set S, a witness set S ′ ⊂ S is a set of points contained in a closed ball of radius r with mutual inter-point distance greater than r 2 .
Comment.
Note that the existence of a witness set S ′ ⊂ S implies that µ(S) ≥ |S ′ |.
The notion of a witness set exists for the density constant, but a similar notion does not exist for the doubling constant.
That is, the addition of points to a set S with doubling constant λ(S) may in fact result in a set with somewhat lower doubling constant than λ(S).
This motivates our decision to define the density constant.Lemma 3.
Given an n-point set S with minimum inter-point distance 1, there exists an O(2 O(log µ(S)) n 3 ) time algorithm that locates a witness set of size ⌈ µ(S)⌉.
Proof.
Note that there are O(n 2 ) inter-point distances in S, so there exist O(n 2 ) distinct balls of S, each of size O(n).
For each ball B(x ∈ S, r), we greedily build the point hierarchy of [KL04] consisting of four radii levels {r, r 2 , r 4 , 1}, where level r contains only one point, and level 1 contains all points.
This can be done in time 2 O(log µ) n per ball (where µ = µ(S)), yielding a total runtime of O(2 O(log µ) n 3 ).
Now there must exist in S a point set S ′ of size exactly µ with radius r and minimum inter-point distance greater than r/2, for some r.
In the hierarchy for the ball that contains S ′ (and possibly contains other points as well), one of the following must hold: (i) Level r 2 contains at least ⌈ √ µ⌉ points; it follows that these points are contained in a ball of radius r and have minimum inter-point distance greater than r 2 , so that they are a witness set.
Or, (ii) Level r 2 contains fewer than ⌈ √ µ⌉ points.
Now, since the µ points of S ′ have minimum distance r 2 , they must be covered by distinct points of level r 4 , so there must exist more than µ points in level r 4 .
It follows that some point of level r 2 covers more than √ µ points of level r 4 .
These points have minimum inter-point distance greater than r 4 and are found in a set of radius less than r 2 , so they are a witness set.Comment.
As an aside, note that the algorithm of Lemma 3 yields a 2-approximation to the doubling dimension of S. Lemma 3 shows that the density constant can be approximated.
In the next section, we will use this tool to develop a bicriteria algorithm for the problem of removing points to obtain a target density constant.
This will in turn allow us to develop a bicriteria algorithm for the problem of removing points to obtain a target doubling constant.
However, for the purposes of efficient algorithmic runtime, we need to introduce a slightly stronger variant of Lemma 3, as follows:Lemma 4.
Given an n-point set S with minimum inter-point distance 1 and a parameter µ ′ ≤ µ(S), there exists an O(2 O(log µ ′ ) n 3 ) time algorithm that locates a maximal collection of distinct witness sets each of size ⌈ √ µ ′ ⌉.
Proof.
The construction is similar to the one presented in the proof of Lemma 3.
We identify all O(n 2 ) balls, and for each ball B(x, r) we build its hierarchy one point at a time.
If the insertion of a point into the hierarchy of B(x, r) implies a witness set of size ⌈ √ µ ′ ⌉ -that is, either level r 2 contains ⌈ √ µ ′ ⌉ points, or a point of level r 2 covers ⌈ √ µ ′ ⌉ points -then we output the witness set as an element of the collection, and delete the points of this witness set from all ball hierarchies.
We then repair the hierarchies (as usual after a deletion, see [KL04]) and resume the hierarchy construction.
The removal of the witness set points and subsequent repair of the hierarchies do not increase the runtime.
Given Lemma 4, we prove the following theorem, which is a bicriteria algorithm for the problem of removing points to achieve a target density constant.
A corollary of this theorem gives a bicriteria algorithm for the problem of removing points to achieve a target doubling constant.Theorem 1.
Given a point set S with density constant µ(S) and a target density constant µ * , let k * = k * (S, µ * ) be the minimum number of points that must be removed from S to obtain a set S * with density constant µ * .
Then there exists a 2 O(log µ * ) n 3 time algorithm that removes k ′ ≤ cµ * +1 (c−1)µ * +1 · k * points from S (for any desired c ≥ 1), and yields a point set S ′ with density constant µ(S ′ ) ≤ (cµ * ) 2 .
Proof.
We first prove the theorem for c = 1.
We run the algorithm of Lemma 3 to find a collection of distinct witness sets of size exactly µ * + 1.
Remove these sets from S.
It follows that the resulting set S ′ has density constant at most (µ * ) 2 .
Now, in the optimal solution S * , at least one of the points in each witness set must be removed.
Hence, the algorithm removes k ′ ≤ (µ * + 1)k * points.Turning to c > 1, we run the algorithm of Lemma 3 to find a collection of distinct witness sets of size exactly cµ * + 1.
Remove these sets from S.
It follows that the resulting set S ′ has density constant at most (cµ * ) 2 .
Now, if our algorithm has removed a witness set of size m, then in the optimal solution at least m − µ * of these points must have been removed.
It follows that the algorithm removesk ′ ≤ cµ * +1 cµ * +1−µ * k * = cµ * +1 (c−1)µ * +1 · k * points from S.This algorithm for the density constant implies a similar one for the doubling constant:Corollary 1.
Given a point set S with doubling constant λ(S) and a target doubling constant λ * , let m * = m * (S, λ * ) be the minimum number of points that must be removed from S to obtain a set S * with doubling constant λ * .
Then there exists an 2 O(log λ * ) n 3 time algorithm that removes m ′ ≤ c(λ * ) 2 +1(c−1)(λ * ) 2 +1 · m * points from S (for any desired c ≥ 1), and yields a point set S ′ with doubling constantλ(S ′ ) ≤ (c(λ * ) 2 ) 2 .
Proof.
The proof follows from Theorem 1 with µ * = (λ * ) 2 .
While the bicriteria algorithms implied by Theorem 1 and Corollary 1 provide a powerful tradeoff for the two point removal problems, the algorithmic runtime may be undesirable for some applications.
Here we present bicriteria algorithms that feature near-linear runtime at the expense of slightly higher dimension.Theorem 2.
Given a point set S with density constant µ(S) and a target density constant µ * , let k * = k * (S, µ * ) be the minimum number of points that must be removed from S to obtain a set S * with density constant µ * .
Then there exists (i) An algorithm that runs in 2 O(log µ * ) n log α time that removes k ′ ≤ cµ * +1(c−1)µ * +1 · k * points from S (for any desired c ≥ 1), and yields a point set S ′ with density constant µ(S ′ ) ≤ (cµ * ) 5 .
(ii) An algorithm that runs in 2 O(log µ * ) n log 3 n time that removes k ′ ≤ cµ * +1(c−1)µ * +1 · k * points from S (for any desired c ≥ 1), and yields a point set S ′ with density constant µ(S ′ ) ≤ (cµ * ) 6 .
Proof.
We begin by building the hierarchy of [KL04] for S, inserting one point at a time.
Now, if a point insertion causes a point of level H 2 i to possess more than (cµ * ) 5 neighbors in H 2 i within distance 32 · 2 i , then we can find a witness set: By building a hierarchy for just the neighbor set on distances {32 · 2 i , 16 · 2 i , 8 · 2 i , 4 · 2 i , 2 · 2 i , 2 i }, we locate in the neighbor set some witness set of size at least cµ * .
(That is, some point in the neighbor set hierarchy must cover cµ * + 1 points one level down, and these points form a witness set for S.) As before, the points of the witness set are then deleted from the hierarchy of S.
The algorithm terminates with set S ′ when no more witness sets can be found.
This can all be be done in O(2 O(log µ * ) n log α) time.
The analysis for optimality of removed points is the same as above.It is only left to show that the resulting set cannot have density constant greater than (cµ * ) 5 : Suppose in contradiction that S ′ contained a witness set of size greater than (cµ * ) 5 with diameter r and minimum inter-point distance r 2 .
Now, each point of the witness set appears in H 1 , the bottom level of the full hierarchy, and a geometric series gives that the distance between each point and its ancestor in level H 2 i is less than 2 i+1 .
Hence, the distance between the level H i ancestors of two different points of the witness set is greater than r 2 − 2 i+2 and less than r + 2 i+2 .
Now let j be the index for which r ≥ 2 j > r 2 .
Let i = j − 3, so that the distance between the ancestors of two points is greater than r 2 − 2 j−1 ≥ 0 (and so at least 2 i ) and less than r + 2 j−1 ≥ 20 · 2 i .
This contradicts the assumption that there does not exist in the hierarchy a set of more than (cµ) 5 points within radius 32 · 2 i and minimum inter-point distance 2 i .
The runtime of 2 O(log µ * ) n log 3 n can be achieved by using the hierarchy of [GR08a] instead of the hierarchy of [KL04].
(Note however that the semi-dynamic hierarchy of [CG06b] or the static hierarchy of [HM05] are not sufficient for our purposes.)
The analysis is similar.This above point removal algorithm for the density constant implies a similar one for the doubling constant:Corollary 2.
Given a point set S with doubling constant λ(S) and a target doubling constant λ * , let m * = m * (S, λ * ) be the minimum number of points that must be removed from S to obtain a set S * with doubling constant λ * .
Then there exists (i) An algorithm that runs in 2 O(log λ) n log α time that removes m ′ ≤ c(λ * ) 2 +1(c−1)(λ * ) 2 +1 · m * points from S (for any desired c ≥ 1), and yields a point set S ′ with dou-bling constant λ(S ′ ) ≤ (c(λ * ) 2 ) 5 .
(ii) An algorithm that runs in 2 O(log λ) n log 3 n time that removes m ′ ≤ c(λ * ) 2 +1(c−1)(λ * ) 2 +1 · m * points from S (for any desired c ≥ 1), and yields a point set S ′ with dou-bling constant λ(S ′ ) ≤ (c(λ * ) 2 ) 6 .
The algorithms of Section 3 are given a point set S, and remove from S a set R, resulting in a set S ′ = S − R of low doubling constant (λ * ) O(1) .
If |R| = O(n 1/2 ) (that is, S is nearly-doubling), we can use techniques from [GR08b, BGK + 10] to construct near-linear runtime algorithms for spanners and fast distance oracles.We first review the spanner of [GR08b] in Section 4.1, and then present the near-linear algorithms in Section 4.2 We review the (1 + ε)-stretch spanner presented in [GR08b] (which itself draws on the work of [GGN06]).
This spanner is constructed as follows: Given a point set S, the point hierarchy of [CG06b] is constructed for S. First, all parentchild pairs in the hierarchy are connected by edges in the spanner; these are the parent-child edges.
Next, we add edges to connect all point pairs p, q ∈ H 5 i (for all i) if p and q are c-neighbors, that is if d(p, q) ≤ c5 i for some fixed constant c = Θ(1/ε).
These are the lateral edges.
Notice that the lateral edges of level H 5 i are much longer than the parent-child edges of that level (by a factor of θ(1/ε)).
The entire construction can be done in time 2 O(log λ(S)) log n + ε −O(log λ(S)) .
It was shown in [GR08b] that given two points p, q ∈ S, there exists a simple spanner path that connects p and q and has stretch at most (1 + ε).
Let p ′ , q ′ ∈ H 5 j be the lowest ancestral c-neighbors of p and q. (That is, j is the smallest index for which p ′ and q ′ , the respective ancestors of p and q in H 5 j , are cneighbors.)
The low stretch spanner path is the path that begins at p, follows a series of parent-child edges up to p ′ , a single lateral edge to q ′ , and a series of parent-child edges down to q.
The length of the path is dominated by the length of the single lateral edge: The length of the lateral edge is Θ(5 j /ε), while the length of all other edges in the path are bounded by two geometric series that each sum to O(5 j ).
This implies a (1 + ε)-stretch spanner path for the pair p, q.
In this section we present near-linear algorithms for nearly-doubling spaces.
We have the following theorem:Theorem 3.
There exists an algorithm that, given point sets S ′ and R (|R| = O( |S ′ |)), builds a (1 + ε)-stretch spanner for S = S ′ ∪ R (n = |S|) with ε −O(log λ * ) n edges in 2 O(log λ * ) n log n + ε −O(log λ * ) n time.Proof.
We first construct the full graph for R, which is a 1-stretch spanner of O(n) edges for these points.
We then construct a (1 + ε) spanner for S ′ in the manner described above.
It is left only to guarantee (1 + ε) stretch between the points of S ′ and R. To this end, for each point p ∈ R we locate the lowest hierarchical level H 2 i of S ′ in which p is covered, and connect p to its covering point with a parent-child edge, and to all points of levels H 2 i and below within distance c2 i using lateral edges.
As in [GR08b], there are ε −O(log λ) edges incident on p, and this construction mimics an actual insertion of p into the hierarchy.
It follows that there exists low stretch paths connecting p ∈ R to all points of S ′ .
The following corollary is a consequence of the spanner construction of Theorem 3.
Corollary 3.
There exists an algorithm that, given point sets S ′ and R (|R| = O( |S ′ |)), computes (i) A (1 + ε) approximation to the minimum spanning tree(MST) for S, in time 2 O(log λ * ) n log n + ε −O(log λ * ) n. (ii) A (1+ε) approximation to all pairs nearest neighbor in time 2 O(log λ * ) n log n+ ε −O(log λ * ) n. (iii) A (1+ε)-approximate distance oracle that supports O(1)-time distance queries with storage 2 O(log λ * log log λ * ) n + ε −O(log λ * ) n, with construction time 2 O(log λ * ) n log n + 2 O(log λ * log log λ * ) n + ε −O(log λ * ) n.Proof.
(i) Given the above (1 + ε)-stretch spanner, a (1 + ε)-approximate MST for S can be construction by a simple breadth first search algorithm (such as Dijkstra's algorithm) on the points and edges of the spanner.
(ii) A (1 + ε)-approximate nearest neighbor for each point p may be found by consulting the spanner edges incident on p, and choosing the closest incident point.
This can be maintained in O(1) time per edge insertion.
(iii) A (1 + ε)-approximate O(1) query time distance oracle for doubling spaces was presented in [BGK + 10].
This oracle was built on the spanner of [GR08b] described above: The structure records the exact distance between any pair of points that are connected in the spanner.
For query points p and q, the algorithm simply locates the lowest ancestral c-neighbors p ′ , q ′ of p, q, and returns their distance.
(Recall that p ′ , q ′ are connected by a lateral edge, so their true distance is recorded in the spanner.)
It follows from the discussion above that the distance between p ′ and q ′ is a (1 + ε)-approximation to the distance between p and q.We extend the construction of [GR08b] to the spanner in the proof of Theorem 3: We record the distance between any pairs of points that are connected in the spanner of the proof of Theorem 3.
It follows that the distance between any pair p, q ∈ R is recorded explicitly.
For all pairs p, q ∈ S ′ , a search for the lowest ancestral c-neighbors of p and q returns an approximation for the distance between p and q. For points p ∈ R and q ∈ S ′ , their distance can similarly be derived via a search for the lowest ancestral c-neighbors, making use of the edges added to the spanner in the construction for the proof of Theorem 3.
