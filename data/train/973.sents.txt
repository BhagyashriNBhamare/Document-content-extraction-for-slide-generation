The cooperative dirty paper coding (DPC) rate region is investigated in a two-transmitter two-receiver network with full channel state information available at all terminals.
The transmitters cooperate by first exchanging messages over an orthogonal cooperation channel, then they mimic a broadcast channel (BC) and jointly perform DPC to send to the two independent receivers.
The allocation of network power and bandwidth between the data and the cooperation channel is studied to characterize the cooperative DPC rate region.
First, the optimal sum power allocation for a multiple access channel (MAC) is presented.
Then through an application of the MAC-BC capacity duality, the cooperative DPC rate region is evaluated under different bandwidth allocation assumptions.
Cooperative DPC outperforms non-cooperative time-division (TD) only when the cooperation channel is strong, since the joint-encoding capacity gain is negated by the overhead of message exchanges in a weak cooperation channel.
Moreover, the cooperative capacity advantage over TD is more pronounced at the maximum sum rate point than when the rate vector is skewed toward one of the users.
In a wireless ad hoc network, neighboring nodes may cooperate by way of joint encoding or processing to increase system performance.
However, such cooperation typically entails some network resources such as the power and bandwidth required to exchange cooperation messages.
Optimizing the allocation of resources in cooperative networks is therefore crucial to characterize the benefits of node cooperation.
In this paper, we study the power and bandwidth allocation when a pair of cooperative transmitters exchange messages over an orthogonal cooperation channel, then jointly perform dirty paper coding (DPC) to send to two independent receivers.
The channel model reduces to the interference channel [1] in the absence of transmitter cooperation.The benefits of cooperative communications in wireless networks have been studied under different performance metrics.
Achievable rate regions of a channel with two cooperative transmitters and a single receiver are presented in [2]- [4].
Cooperative diversity is studied in [5], where the transmitters forward parity bits of the detected symbols to one another.

Under fading channels, [6] shows that orthogonal cooperative protocols can achieve full spatial diversity order.
Upper bounds and achievable multiplexing gains of cooperative networks are presented in [7].
Information-theoretic achievable rate regions and bounds are given in [8]- [12] for channels with transmitter and/or receiver cooperation.This paper is based on the same two-transmitter, tworeceiver ad hoc network with orthogonal cooperation channels studied in [13], [14].
In those papers, the sum rates are characterized for a DPC transmitter cooperation scheme and a Wyner-Ziv compress-and-forward receiver cooperation scheme in a network that has a symmetric topology.
It is shown that the DPC scheme offers most of the capacity gain when the cooperating nodes are close together.
In this paper, we focus on the DPC transmitter cooperation scheme only, without receiver cooperation, and consider the power and bandwidth allocation between the data channel and cooperation channel to characterize the entire cooperative DPC rate region.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
Section II presents the system model and the cooperative DPC transmission scheme.
Section III derives the optimal sum power allocation in a multiple access channel (MAC), the results of which are applied via duality in Section IV when cooperative DPC power and bandwidth allocation is considered.
Numerical results of the cooperative DPC rate regions under Rayleigh fading are presented in Section V. Section VI concludes the paper.
Consider an ad hoc network with two clustered transmitters and two independent receivers as shown in Fig. 1.
We assume the transmitters within the cluster are close together, but the distance between the transmitter cluster and receivers is large.
The channel gains are denoted by h 1 , . . . , h 4 ∈ C.
We assume a slow fading environment where the nodes can track the channel conditions accurately.
In particular, we assume all nodes have perfect channel state information (CSI), and the transmitters are able to adapt to the channel realizations h 1 , . . . , h 4 .
In a fast fading environment where accurate channel tracking is difficult, the perfect CSI case provides an upper bound to the system performance.TX cluster Fig. 1.
System model of the cooperative transmitter cluster.Receivers √ G h 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 (x i , y i ) (x ′ i , y ′ i ) B t , P t B, P 1 + P 2There are two orthogonal communication channels: the data channel between the transmitter cluster and the receivers, and the cooperation channel between the transmitters.
In the data channel, Transmitter 1 sends to Receiver 1 at rate R 1 , and likewise Transmitter 2 sends to Receiver 2 at rate R 2 .
Let x [x 1 x 2 ] T ∈ C 2 denote the transmit signals, and y [y 1 y 2 ] T ∈ C 2 denote the corresponding received signals.
In matrix form, the data channel can be written asy = Hx + n 1 n 2 , H h 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 ,(1)where n 1 , n 2 ∼ CN (0, 1) are iid zero-mean circularly symmetric complex Gaussian (ZMCSCG) white noise with unit variance.
Let B denote the bandwidth of the data channel, andP 1 E[|x 1 | 2 ], P 2 E[|x 2 | 2 ]denote the transmission power of Transmitter 1 and Transmitter 2, respectively, where the expectation is taken over repeated channel uses.
There is also a static, additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) cooperation channel between the two transmitters with channel gain √ G.
As we assume the cooperating nodes are close together, the case of interest is when G is large.
We assume the two transmitters can simultaneously transmit and receive on this full-duplex cooperation channel.
Let x ′ 1 , x ′ 2 ∈ C be the transmit signals, and y ′ 1 , y ′ 2 ∈ C the received signals, then the cooperation channel is described byy ′ 1 = √ Gx ′ 2 + n 3 , y ′ 2 = √ Gx ′ 1 + n 4 ,(2)where n 3 , n 4 ∼ CN (0, 1) are iid unit-variance ZMCSCG noise.
Let B t denote the transmitter cooperation channel bandwidth, andP t E |x ′ 1 | 2 + |x ′ 2 | 2 denote the cooperation transmission power.To capture the system-wide cost of cooperation, we consider a total network power constraint P on the data and cooperation transmissions: P 1 + P 2 + P t ≤ P .
We assume a short-term power constraint for each channel realization; power allocation across fading states is not considered in this paper.
Moreover, we consider two assumptions associated with the allocation of bandwidth between the data channel and the cooperation channel: Under bandwidth assumption 1), we assume dedicated orthogonal channels for cooperation, where each of these dedicated channels has a bandwidth of 1 Hz (i.e., B = B t = 1).
Under bandwidth assumption 2), however, there is a single 1 Hz channel to be divided into two different bands to implement the cooperative schemes.We thus allocate B and B t such that B t + B = 1.
Bandwidth assumption 1) is applicable when the short-range cooperative communications takes place in separate bands which may be spatially reused across all cooperating nodes in the system.
In contrast, bandwidth assumption 2) is applicable when spatial reuse is not considered.
In the cooperative dirty paper coding transmission scheme, the transmitters first fully exchange their intended messages over the orthogonal cooperation channel, after which the network becomes equivalent to a multi-antenna broadcast channel (BC) with a two-antenna transmitter:y 1 = f 1 x + n 1 , y 2 = f 2 x + n 2 ,(3)where f 1 , f 2 are the rows of H:f 1 h 1 h 2 , f 2 h 3 h 4 .
(4)The transmitters then jointly encode both messages using dirty paper coding (DPC) [15], which is capacity-achieving for the multi-antenna Gaussian BC [16].
Causality is not violated since we can offset the transmitter cooperation and DPC communication by one block.
We assume the transmitters are synchronized, which may be achieved through an external clock or exchanging timing reference signals.In order to characterize the rate region of this cooperative DPC transmission scheme, we must determine the optimal power and bandwidth allocation between the data and cooperation channels.
We define the cooperative DPC rate region as the convex hull of the set of rates (R 1 , R 2 ) achievable by the cooperative DPC scheme.
Each point on the boundary of the rate region can be characterized, for a given µ, 0 ≤ µ ≤ 1, in terms of the maximization:d * (µ) max (R1,R2) µR 1 + (1 − µ)R 2 ,(5)where (R 1 , R 2 ) is achievable by cooperative DPC.
For a given µ, µR 1 + (1 − µ)R 2 = d * (µ) defines a tangent to rate region boundary.
The cooperative DPC rate region is thus given by the intersection of the halfspaces:C coop-DPC = 0≤µ≤1 (R 1 , R 2 ) | µR 1 + (1 − µ)R 2 ≤ d * (µ) .
In the cooperative DPC scheme, after the transmitters exchange messages, the cooperative network becomes equivalent to a BC with two independent receivers.
It is well-known that the capacity region of the BC equals that of its dual MAC under a sum power constraint [17], [18].
Thus, in this section we derive the optimal allocation of sum power between the users in a MAC, which via duality also yields the optimal power allocation for the BC capacity region.
In the following sections we focus on the instantaneous rates for a given fading state (i.e., conditioned on H).
The ergodic rate regions under Rayleigh fading in Section V are computed by averaging over the fading states.Consider a MAC with two single-antenna transmitters and a two-antenna receiver.
Let the channel be described byy = h 1 x 1 + h 2 x 2 + n,(6)where y ∈ C 2 is the received signal vector; x 1 , x 2 ∈ C are the signals sent by Tx 1 and Tx 2, respectively;h 1 [h 11 h 12 ] T ∈ C 2 , h 2 [h 21 h 22 ] T ∈ C 2are the channel vectors; and n ∈ C 2 is unit-variance ZMCSCG white noise with E[nn H ] = I.
We assume perfect CSI, and thus h 1 , h 2 are known to the transmitters and the receiver.
Suppose Tx 1 has power P 1 , and Tx 2 has power P 2 .
Since the inputs x 1 , x 2 are scalars (each transmitter has only one antenna), the MAC capacity region is given by the pentagon [19]:R 1 ≤ log|I + h 1 P 1 h H 1 | (7) R 2 ≤ log|I + h 2 P 2 h H 2 | (8) R 1 + R 2 ≤ log|I + h 1 P 1 h H 1 + h 2 P 2 h H 2 |,(9)where R 1 is the transmission rate of Tx 1, and R 2 is that of Tx 2.
Suppose we write P 1 = αP s , P 2 = (1 − α)P s , where P s can be interpreted as the sum power constraint, and the power allocation parameter α ∈ [0, 1] is to be optimized.
To numerically calculate the optimal sum power allocation at the sum capacity, an iterative algorithm was given in [20], which was based on the iterative waterfilling algorithm for MIMO MACs with individual power constraints [21].
However, we wish to find the optimal sum power allocation for all points on the capacity region boundary (i.e., including non-sumcapacity rate vectors).
Hence we solve the optimal sum power allocation analytically using the Lagrange method, and its derivation is given in Appendix I.In the next section we will again refer to the optimal MAC sum power allocation when we consider the power and bandwidth allocation in the cooperative DPC scheme.
As noted in Appendix I, the BC capacity region boundary comprises three segments: the rate vectors achieved by decode order (1) (the receiver decodes in the order: Tx 2, Tx 1), the ones by decode order (2) (the receiver decodes in the order: Tx 1, Tx 2), and the ones on the straight line segment achieved via time-sharing between the two decode orders.
When we examine the power and bandwidth allocation in cooperative DPC in Section IV, all three segments of the BC region boundary need to be considered.
In cooperative DPC, the transmitters can perform joint encoding only when they know the codewords of each other.
The target transmission rate vector (R 1 , R 2 ), therefore, must be supported by both the cooperation channel as well as the resulting BC after the transmitters have exchanged messages.
Since capacity is non-decreasing in transmit power, there is no surplus in power under optimal allocation.
We assume that the transmitters use power P t to exchange their messages through the cooperation channel, and then perform DPC over the data channel with the remaining power P 1 + P 2 = P − P t .
The cooperative DPC rate region can then be characterized by the intersection of the cooperation channel and the BC capacity regions:max Pt,Bt,B µR 1 + (1 − µ)R 2(10)such that:(R 1 , R 2 ) ∈ C BC (P − P t , B) (11) (R 1 , R 2 ) ∈ C co (P t , B t ),(12)where C BC (P − P t , B) is the BC capacity region with power P − P t and bandwidth B, and similarly C co (P t , B t ) is the transmitter cooperation channel capacity region with power P t and bandwidth B t .
By duality, the BC capacity region equals that of the dual MAC under the same sum power constraint, i.e., C BC (P − P t , B) = C MAC (P − P t , B).
The cooperation channel is full-duplex with channel gain√ G; hence (R 1 , R 2 ) ∈ C co (P t , B t ) iff (2 R1/Bt − 1)B t /G + (2 R2/Bt − 1)B t /G ≤ P t ,(13)which follows from the capacity of an AWGN channel.
Under bandwidth assumption 1), we set B t = B = 1, and P t is the only optimization variable.
Under bandwidth assumption 2), we write B = 1 − B t , so the optimization is over P t , B t .
For fixed P t , B t , the regions C BC and C co are convex; hence so is their intersection.
If only the BC region constraint (11) is active, then the problem reduces to a sum power allocation optimization for the dual MAC, which was obtained in Section III, with the solution given in Appendix I.
In this case, the maximizing BC rate vector (R * 1,BC , R * 2,BC ) lies on the boundary of C BC but in the interior of C co .
We denote the P t , B t for which this is true as region (i) in the power/bandwidth allocation space.
To test if (R * 1,BC , R * 2,BC ) lies in the interior of C co , we stipulate that its power requirement be strictly feasible for the cooperation channel, i.e., we require that(2 R * 1,BC /Bt − 1)B t /G + (2 R * 2,BC /Bt − 1)B t /G < P t .
(14)Additional consideration is needed, however, when we maximize the sum rate of the BC region.
When µ = 0.5 in (10), corresponding to the sum rate point, all rate vectors on the time-sharing segment of the BC region boundary are optimal and have the same sum rate.
Accordingly, to maximize sum rate we select the rate vector on the time-sharing segment that requires the minimum cooperation channel power when we apply (14) to determine its feasibility.
The minimum cooperation channel power is derived in Appendix II-B.
Conversely, if only the cooperation channel region constraint (12) is active, the maximization becomes a sum power allocation optimization problem in the cooperation channel.
This can be solved with similar steps as in the MAC optimal sum power allocation, and the solution is given in Appendix II-A.
In this case, the maximizing cooperation channel rate vector (R * 1,co , R * 2,co ) lies on the boundary of C co but in the interior of C BC .
We denote the corresponding P t , B t as region (ii).
The condition for region (ii) can be verified by checking if (R * 1,co , R * 2,co ) is strictly feasible in the dual MAC with decode order (1), (2) or with time-sharing.
Lastly, if both constraints (11) and (12) are active, the maximizing rate vector lies on the intersection of the boundaries of C BC and C co .
We denote the corresponding P t , B t as region (iii).
In this case, the rate vector is computed by equating the two capacity region boundaries.
Specifically, under bandwidth assumption 1), as B t = B, the intersecting rate vectors are found by solving a set of quadratic equations when the rates are achievable by MAC decode order (1) or (2).
If an intersecting rate vector lies on the time-sharing segment of the BC region boundary, then the solution is numerically computed as it involves solving equations with non-integer powers.
Under bandwidth assumption 2), all the intersecting rate vectors have to be numerically computed as they again involve solving equations with non-integer powers.
Of all intersecting rate vectors, the one that maximizes µR 1 +(1−µ)R 2 produces the cooperative DPC achievable rate.In regions (i) and (ii), the weighted sum of rates µR 1 + (1 − µ)R 2 is concave in P t , B t .
In fact, as channel capacity increases with available transmit power and bandwidth, the rate in region (i) is monotonically increasing in P −P t , 1−B t , and the rate in region (ii) is monotonically increasing in P t , B t .
Consequently, if we apply one of the standard one-dimensional or multi-dimensional numerical optimization algorithms (e.g., see those in [22]), we arrive at a maximum in region (iii), and the suboptimal rates in regions (i) and (ii) are rejected due to their monotonicity.
Numerically we have observed that region (iii) appears to be concave in P t , B t .
If so that would imply a local maximum in the region is indeed a global maximum.
However, as the rates in this region are numerically computed, the region's concavity cannot be readily verified.
In this section, we illustrate the rate regions of the cooperative DPC transmission scheme with optimized power and bandwidth.
We consider the network in Fig. 1, and assume that the channels h 1 , . . . , h 4 experience independent Rayleigh fading with unit power.
The numerical results are generated by averaging the rate regions associated with 1000 randomlygenerated channel realizations.
Specifically, for each channel realization, we evaluate the power and bandwidth allocation in cooperative DPC as described in Section IV.
We then compute the ergodic rate regions by averaging over the channel realizations.The cooperative DPC rate regions are plotted in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, for G = 0 dB and G = 10 dB, respectively.
We assume a network power constraint of P = 10 dB.
For comparison, in each plot we also show the BC ergodic capacity region that corresponds to the case when the two transmitters are colocated (G = ∞).
In addition, we compare cooperative DPC against non-cooperation.
Without cooperation, the network is an interference channel, for which an achievable rate region is given in [23].
However, the said rate region is characterized in terms of a set of inequalities, under which evaluating the maximization in (5) is rather involved.
Instead, we compare the cooperative DPC rates against a non-cooperative transmission scheme where each transmitter sends to its respective receiver by time-division (TD).
Note that under each channel realization, the TD capacity region boundary is given by a straight line segment.
The TD ergodic capacity regions shown in the plots are averaged over the channel realizations.We observe that when the cooperation channel is weak (i.e., when G is small), the transmitters need to spend significant power and bandwidth exchanging messages.
Thus, in this case the cooperative schemes fail to surpass the non-cooperative TD capacity, especially when bandwidth needs to be allocated between the data and the cooperation channel.
When G is large, however, cooperative DPC begins to outperform the non-cooperative TD transmission scheme.
For a given G, the cooperative capacity gain over TD is more pronounced at the sum rate point (i.e., µ = 0.5) than when the rate vector weight µ is skewed towards one of the users (i.e., µ ≈ 0 or µ ≈ 1).
We also show the DPC regions under equal bandwidth allocation (B t = B = 0.5) for comparison.
Equal bandwidth allocation is close to optimal at G = 0 dB, but its performance gap with the optimal allocation widens as G increases.
In this paper we have studied the power and bandwidth allocation in an ad hoc network with a pair of cooperating transmitters.
The transmitters cooperate by first exchanging their messages over an orthogonal cooperation channel, then they perform DPC to transmit the messages jointly to the independent receivers.
We derive the optimal sum power allocation for a MAC, which we then use in an application of MAC-BC capacity duality to compute the cooperative DPC rate regions under different bandwidth allocation assumptions.
When the cooperation channel is weak, cooperative DPC performs worse than non-cooperative TD, since the overhead of exchanging messages between the transmitters outweighs the capacity gain from joint-encoding.
On the other hand, when the cooperation channel is strong, cooperative DPC outperforms noncooperative TD transmission.
We have considered the case where the transmitters cooperate but the receivers decode independently in this paper.
Our analysis has only considered transmitter cooperation.
Further gains may be obtained if the receivers as well as the transmitters cooperate, assuming the resources required for this cooperation are not sufficient to cancel the associated gains.
Consider the multiple-antenna MAC described in (6): each of the two transmitters has a single antenna, the receiver has two antennas, and the channel vectors are given by h 1 , h 2 .
We write Tx 1's power constraint as P 1 = αP s , and Tx 2's power constraint as P 2 = (1 − α)P s , where P s is the sum power constraint.
We consider the optimization of the power allocation parameter α ∈ [0,1] in this section.Let B be the bandwidth of the MAC, then in terms of the sum power the MAC capacity region (7), (8), and (9) can be written asR 1 ≤ B log I + h 1 (αP s /B)h H 1 (15) R 2 ≤ B log I + h 2 ((1 − α)P s /B)h H 2 (16) R 1 +R 2 ≤ B log I + h 1 (αP s /B)h H 1 + h 2 ((1 − α)P s /B)h H 2 .
For notational convenience, we defineK 1 h 1 2 F P s /B, K 2 h 2 2 F P s /B, K 0 h 0 P 2 s /B 2 ,where · F denotes the Frobenius norm, andh 0 |h 11 | 2 |h 22 | 2 + |h 21 | 2 |h 12 | 2 − 2ℜ{h 11 h * 12 h * 21 h 22 }.
Now the capacity region can be written more compactly asR 1 ≤ B log 1 + K 1 α (17) R 2 ≤ B log 1 + K 2 (1 − α) (18) R 1 + R 2 ≤ B log 1 + K 1 α + K 2 (1 − α) + K 0 α(1 − α) .
(19)The capacity region of a MAC under a sum power constraint is closed and convex [17]; under each given fading state (i.e., conditioned on h 1 , h 2 ), it can be characterized by the following convex optimization:max (R1,R2)∈CMAC µR 1 + (1 − µ)R 2 ,(20)where µ ∈ [0, 1] is given, and C MAC is the MAC capacity region described in (17), (18) and (19).
As µ ranges from 0 to 1, (20) traces the boundary of the capacity region.
When µ > 0.5 (i.e., R 1 is weighted more favorably than R 2 ), it is optimal to decode Tx 1's signal last, after decoding and canceling Tx 2's signal [19].
We call this decode order (1), and the following rates are achieved:R (1) 1 = B log 1 + K 1 α (21) R (1) 2 = B log 1 + (1 − α)(K 2 + K 0 α) 1 + K 1 α .
(22)Under decode order (1), the maximization in (20) becomesmax 0≤α≤1 µR (1) 1 + (1 − µ)R (1) 2(23)⇒ max0≤α≤1 (2µ − 1)B log 1 + K 1 α +(1 − µ)B log 1 + K 1 α + K 2 (1 − α) + K 0 α(1 − α) .
Note that K 1 , K 2 , K 0 ≥ 0 from their definitions, so (24) is concave in α.
Next we form the Lagrangian:L(α, λ 1 , λ 2 ) = −(2µ−1)B log K 1 α+1 +λ 1 (α−1)−λ 2 α − (1 − µ)B log −K 0 α 2 + (K 1 − K 2 + K 0 )α + K 2 + 1 .
Applying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, the gradient of the Lagrangian vanishes at the optimal sum power allocation α * .
It can be found by solving a quadratic equation with the coefficients:a K 1 K 0 (24) b (−K 2 1 + K 1 K 2 − K 1 K 0 − 2K 0 )µ + 2K 0 (25) c (−2K 1 K 2 − K 1 − K 2 + K 0 )µ + K 1 K 2 + K 2 − K 0 .
(26)The KKT conditions state that at the optimal α * , either one of the inequality constraints is active, or the gradient of the objective function is zero.
When a 񮽙 = 0, the solution can be summarized asα * =          0 if b 2 − 4ac < 0 or r 1 > 1 or r 2 < 0 r 2 else if 0 ≤ r 2 ≤ 1 r 1 else if 0 ≤ r 1 ≤ 1 1 else,(27)where r 1 , r 2 are the roots of the quadratic:r 1 = −b − √ b 2 − 4ac 2a , r 2 = −b + √ b 2 − 4ac 2a .
(28)On the other hand, when µ < 0.5 (i.e., R 2 is weighted more favorably than R 1 ), the reverse decoder order is optimal: we decode Tx 2's signal last, after decoding and canceling Tx 1's signal.
We call this decode order (2), and similarly steps can be used to derive the optimal sum power allocation α * under decode order (2).
When µ = 0.5, decode orders (1) and (2) result in the same power allocation α * and the same sum rate R 1 + R 2 .
The linear combination of the rate vectors (R(1) 1 , R (1) 2 ) and (R (2) 1 , R(2)2 ) can be achieved via time-sharing between the two decode orders.
We consider power allocation in the full-duplex AWGN transmitter cooperation channel described in (2): the channel gain in each direction is √ G, and we let P t , B t , respectively, be the transmit power constraint and the bandwidth of the channel.
Suppose Tx 1 uses power τ P t , and Tx 2 uses power (1 − τ )P t , where τ ∈ [0,1].
In this section, we consider the optimal cooperation channel sum power allocation.
The capacity region of the cooperation channel can be characterized by the convex optimization: max 0≤τ ≤1 µR 1 + (1 − µ)R 2 , where µ ∈ [0, 1] is given, R 1 is the rate Tx 1 sends to Tx 2, and R 2 is the rate in the other direction.
Being an AWGN channel in each direction, the channel capacities are given byR 1 = B t log(1 + τ GP t /B t ) (29) R 2 = B t log(1 + (1 − τ )GP t /B t ).
(30)The maximization is concave in τ , and steps similar to those in Appendix I can be used to derive the solution.
The optimal cooperation channel sum power allocation is found to be:τ * = min max 0, 2µ − 1 + µGP t /B t GP t /B t , 1 .
(31) On the BC region boundary time-sharing segment, all rate vectors have the same sum rate R 1 + R 2 ; however, they do not have the same power requirement in the cooperation channel.
In this section, we find the rate vector on the BC time-sharing segment that requires the minimum cooperation channel power.
We make use of this result in Section IV when we test if a rate vector on the BC region boundary lies inside of the cooperation channel capacity region.Let us consider the time-sharing rates between two given rate vectors (R 2 ), with the Lagrange method we can find the optimal time-sharing variable t * that minimizes the cooperation channel requirement: t * = min{max{0, ˜ t }, 1}, where˜t where˜ where˜t = R (2) 2 − R (2) 1 + log (R2 − R2 )/(R1 − R1 )R (1) 1 − R (2) 1 + R (2) 2 − R (1) 2.
