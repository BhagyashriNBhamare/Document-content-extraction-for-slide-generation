This paper offers a computational study of finger localization on 2-D curved objects using tactile data which builds on efficient numerical processing of curves.
Our first algorithm localizes one rolling finger on a stationary object.
It finds all boundary segments with the same arc length and total curvature computed from tactile data.
The algorithm slides an imaginary segment along the object boundary by alternatively marching its two endpoints forward, stretching or contracting the segment if necessary.
Through a curvature-based analysis we establish the global convergence of the algorithm to every location of such a segment and also derive the local convergence rate.
The algorithm runs in time linear in the size of the discretized boundary curve domain, which is asymptotically as fast as computing the object's perimeter through numerical integration.
Based on the above results, we then present a global algorithm to localize two fingers rolling on a free object.
This has considerably improved over our previous local algorithm [6] using a least-squares formulation.
The algorithm partitions the object boundary into segments over which related total curvature functions are monotonic.
Then it combines bisection with forward marching to search for possible locations of the fingers within every pair of such segments.
A robot grasping strategy often relies on knowledge of the exact placement of the fingers on an object.
The use of tactile information combined with object geometry can facilitate the localization of the fingers relative to the object.
In this paper, we investigate how one or two fingers with tactile capability can actively determine their locations on a curved object from a few contact points recorded on the fingertips.The action taken by the fingers is rolling on the object, which is bounded by a known parametric 2-D curve with nontrivial curvature undefined at no more than a few ¡ Support for this research was provided by Iowa State University.
isolated points.
The kinematics of rolling together with recorded finger contacts will reduce localization to identifying curve segments on the object boundary that meet geometric requirements on arc length and total curvature.In Section 2 we study a simple version of localization with one disk-like finger rolling on a stationary curved object.
We will present a numerical algorithm with provable behavior.
In Section 3 we move on to the problem of localizing two rolling fingers on a free object.
The problem was studied earlier in [6] but only partially solved by a leastsquares method.
Built on the results in Section 2, a global algorithm is presented to find locations of both rolling fingers.
Simulations will be presented in Section 4, followed by further discussions in Section 5.
This work is founded on contact kinematics which describe the motion of a point contact between two rigid bodies by a set of differential equations [11,2].
The special kinematics of rolling motion allow finger localization to be formulated as a purely geometric problem.
Grimson and Lozano-Pérez [5] used tactile measurements of positions and surface normals for recognition and localization of 3D polyhedra.
Kriegman and Ponce [8] applied elimination theory to match curved three-dimensional objects with the shape of image contours through fitting.
Rimon and Blake [12] showed how to "cage" a 2-dimensional object using two fingers but only one degree of control.Allen and Roberts [1] deployed robot fingers to obtain a number of contact points around an object and used fitting to reconstruct the object's shape.
Erdmann [3] showed that the local geometry of an object with known angular velocity can be recovered by two passive linear tactile sensors.
Extending this work, Moll and Erdmann [10] applied quasi-static dynamics to reconstruct the shape of a convex object and estimate its motion from tactile readings on two palms in frictionless contact with the object.Fischler [4] described an algorithm to locate points with extreme curvatures on planar curves and reconstruct the original curves based on these points.
Mokhtarian and Mackworth [9] used inflection points (where curvatures are zero) for planar curve descriptions and matching.
In the author's recent work [6], the problem of localizing two rolling fingers on a free object was presented with a least-squares solution.
Nevertheless, the solution method guaranteed neither convergence nor completeness and was slow.
In Section 3, we will present a global numerical algorithm to solve the same problem.
We first look at how to determine the location of a finger rolling on a stationary object.
Both the finger and the object can be of any shape as long as they maintain point contact.
Let the object be bounded by a regular curve¢ £ ¥ ¤ § ¦, where ¤ is the location of contact.

Bisection will be invoked in the modes convex-concave and concave-convex.

Now we consider that the object is no longer stationary.
It moves in response to the disk rolling.

The ambiguities were eliminated with extra tactile data taken at a fourth pair of contact positions.
Tactile sensing in the rolling mode reduces the localization of fingers to constraint satisfaction in multiple variables.
The presented algorithms exploit curve geometry to run in time linear in the size of the discretized curve domain.
This is achieved by partitioning the curve domain into intervals monotonic with respect to related functions and then by combining bisection with marching.
The completeness of these algorithms distinguish themselves from a local optimization approach (based on least squares, for instance) whose success heavily relies on initial estimates.The marching algorithm described in Section 2 can be easily generalized to find all length-Q segments on a curve, open or closed, over which the integral of a function é £ ¢ ¦ equals some constant ê .
An industrial application often handles large quantities of identical parts.
The precomputation of inflections and vertices is thus a one-time overhead for one part shape.A key implementation issue is to ensure rolling contact between both fingers and the object.
We are currently experimenting with one straight jaw and one passive wheel on a vertical pin.
