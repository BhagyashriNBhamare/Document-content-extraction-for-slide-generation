A 2-axis force/torque sensor has been designed for contact sensing and the localization of 2-D curved shapes.
The sensor is an aluminum piece attached with two "chip sensors", each a half-bridge circuit consisting of two strain gauges.
It functions like a "wrist" which uses the two chip sensors to detect bending and twisting moments, respectively.
When an external force is exerted on a jaw mounted with the F/T sensor, the point of force application is linearly related to the ratio between the reading variations from the chip sensors.
This principle is used for determining contact locations on the jaw after calibration.
A simple strategy is later described to control the jaw to roll on a motionless 2-D object while estimating the movement of contact.
Given its shape, the object's position and orientation relative to the jaw can also be estimated during the rolling motion.
Experiments have been conducted with an Adept Cobra 600 manipulator.
Force/torque and tactile sensors have been used in a wide range of tasks from shape perception and recognition to grasping and dexterous manipulation.
They play an important role in the dynamic integration of sensing into robot manipulation, a process that will hopefully make the robot exhibit skills that approach the human level.While a combination of tactile, force, and position sensing carries the promise of enhancing the flexibility and robustness of robotic manipulation [6], the integration of different control strategies for multiple sensor modalities can become very sophisticated and unreliable at the present stage.
From a minimalist point of view, one sensor modality should be preferred if it could yield sufficient information needed for executing a task.
¡ Support for this research was provided in part by Iowa State University, and in part by the National Science Foundation through a CAREER award IIS-0133681.
Meanwhile, industrial sensors are somewhat expensive for lab experiments, particularly those on small scales.
A tactile array sensor could easily cost over $10,000.
Less expensive force/torque sensors such as the ATI F/T-16 may be easily broken due to their narrow force and torque ranges.In this paper we describe a low-cost 2-axis force/torque sensor capable of contact sensing and shape localization.
Section 2 presents the sensor design, its underlying principles, and calibration.
Section 3 introduces a strategy that implements the rolling motion of a jaw (mounted with the sensor) on an immobilized object.
This strategy is used in the experiments in Section 4 for localizing the object relative to the jaw.
Finally, Section 5 summarizes the work and outlines future improvements and directions.
Our sensor design objective is to demonstrate a strategy that localizes a motionless curved object relative to a jaw rolling on its boundary.
This strategy is illustrated in Figure 1.
The location of contact is unknown on the object boundary.
A touch sensor records the first contact location ¤ on the jaw, which then rolls along the object boundary to complete a on the jaw equals the length of the boundary segment traced out by the contact.
The rotation of the tangent as the contact moves through the segment, referred to as the total curvature, equals the jaw rotation , which is measured by the Adept controller.
The problem of object localization now reduces to locating one or more curve segments with length ¢ and total curvature on the boundary.
In the previous work [13], we gave an algorithm that guarantees to find (up to numerical resolution) all such segments in a running time on the same order as computing the object's perimeter through numerical integration.
In case multiple segments are found, the algorithm examines the total curvatures of their following segments of some equal length.Experimentally, we need to be able to locate contact on the jaw as well as generate (or approximate) the rolling motion.
Simple force control will be needed.
Thus a tactile array sensor is not preferred.
Also a tactile array sensor would require direct contact with the object, likely complicating the jaw design.
We have designed a simple 2-axis force/torque sensor to serve as a "wrist" which will be able to estimate contact after proper calibration.
Salisbury [18] first proposed the concept of fingertip force sensing with a geometric approach for determining contact locations and orientations from force and moment measurements.
This work was extended by Bicchi [2] who offered a mathematical solution to the problem of determining some global qualities of contact as well.
Principles of contact position detection from force/torque measurements were also derived by Tsujimura and Yabuta [19] who went further to show how to detect various shapes.
Brock and Chiu [3] designed a fingertip sensor consisting of four strain gauge half-bridges and used it to measure surface contact location and orientation as well as the center of mass.
Zhou et al. [21] re-examined fingertip contact sensing with a focus on the elimination of gravitational biasing and error analysis, and demonstrated their sensor design with a hand manipulation system.Contact forces and locations on a multi-link manipulator can be calculated from joint torque readings only.
For the case of a multi-jointed link with an unknown object, Kaneko and Tanie [14] approximated the contact location between them as the intersection point of two postures of the link resulting from a small angular displacement under compliance.
Grupen and Huber [10] used kinematic constraints and linear observers; they also calculated contact force from joint torque readings.
Employing kinematics and nonlinear observers, Haidacher and Hirzinger [11] studied how multiple robotic fingers without tactile capability can utilize their relative velocities to estimate contact points and velocities on an object.Measurements of contact may be considerably improved through integrating tactile information [9].
Fearing [7] designed a cylindrical tactile fingertip mounted on the Stanford/JPL hand for contact localization and regrasping.
The fingertip was later employed [8] to determine principal curvatures on spheres, cylinders, etc.
Based on continuum mechanics and photoelastic stress analysis, Cameron et al. [4] built a tactile sensor to detect changes in contact status and realize smooth phase transitions during a task.
This idea of dynamic tactile sensing was extended by Howe and Cutkosky [12] to capture fine surface features during motion.
Zhang and Chen [20] introduced two mappings from tactile images to contact states that can facilitate the feedback control.Dynamic control of rolling contacts in the presence of tactile information has been studied in dexterous multi-arm manipulation [16], where nonlinear feedback schemes are employed.
Rolling a manipulator on a fixed object generates compliant motion.
Raibert and Craig [17] described a hybrid position/force strategy using an internal wrist sensor built on strain gauges to meet with manipulator trajectory constraints.
Mason [15] synthesized control strategies for compliant motions by looking into the semantics of motion primitives.Our sensor design is influenced by the work of Abe et al.[1] on implementing a 3-axis force/torque sensor sensitive to small reaction forces and torques in the plane but very stiff in other directions.
We use a simple geometric strategy to generate the "effects of rolling", which are needed for localization.
The main structure of the 2-axis force/torque sensor as shown in Figure 2 Each chip sensor is wired to a set of electronics for conditioning and amplifying to yield an output in the range of 0-5 VDC.

The gauge factor is a con- is also proportional to the stress and hence to the moment exerted on the material.
So the voltage variation !
scales with the moment.
Below we determine the ratio between the bending stress and the twisting stress and explain how it can be used for locating contact.
The chip sensor £ ¤ is sensitive to a bending moment about the horizontal axis of the jaw but not to a twisting moment about its vertical axis.
The chip sensor £ ¥ ¦ is sensitive to a twisting moment but not to a bending moment.
The coupling effects are assumed to be negligible in our analysis.

To test the sensitivity of the wrist, we let the Adept command the jaw to move compliantly when touched.
Continuous compliant motion of the jaw is generated while the touch is maintained.
A touch in the middle results in pure translation of the jaw while a touch at a different location results in both translation and rotation.
To calibrate the 2-axis sensor, the jaw in a fixed orientation repeatedly makes contact with an immobilized object as shown in Figure 4.
Before making the next contact, the jaw translates by 1cm along the tangential direction.
The contact point on the object boundary does not change but the contact points on the jaw as a result have 1cm spacings.
During the contact, voltage readings of the sensor £ ¤ are maintained at some constant level (2.1V) when readings of the sensor £ ¦ are taken.
This is achieved by simple feedback control under which the Adept manipulator translates the jaw over small distances along its normal direction while staying in touch with the object.
Figure 5 shows a cubic spline that interpolates eleven ratios between votage variations on the two chip sensors when the contact distance reflects the torque about the wrist's axis of symmetry, the spline agrees well with our theory that under constant contact force the moment scales with the contact distance from the axis.
The discrepancy between the spline and a straight line could be attributed to various factors such as strain distribution over an area on the chip sensor not just at its center point, area contact (instead of point contact), nonlinearity of the voltage output, wire strain on the chip sensors, imperfect sensor mounting, possible tilting of the jaw, strain gauge noise, etc.To determine the (horizontal) location of a contact on the jaw, we need only intersect the horizontal line of an average reading¥ ¤ £ X ¥ ¤ £ ¦ ¥with the calibration spline.
Measurement drifts due to time and temperature are relatively small.
All the drifts tended to be in one direction.We conducted tests on the accuracy of this spline-based calibration.
In such a test, the jaw made contact at an arbitrary location on the object boundary.
Then it translated at each step by a fixed distance along the tangential direction so that the contact point moved on the jaw in the opposite direction by the same distance.
Meanwhile, the estimated movements from sensor readings using the calibration spline were then compared with the actual movements.
The result of one such test is plotted in Figure 6.
As discussed earlier in Section 1.1, the rolling motion is a precondition for the localization algorithm to be applicable.
stay say, around 2.1V, which is slightly below the default value 2.5V.
It then repeatedly carries out a sequence of rotations alternated with translations along the normal direction.
More specifically, the jaw first rotates by a small angle.
As it moves further "into" the object or away from it, the voltage reading of £ ¤ decreases or increases respectively.
The jaw then backs up or moves forward in small steps accordingly until the readings return to around 2.1V.Let us justify that the above strategy simulates rolling.

So the distance degree in each instance.
The jaw and the object were in contact almost all the time during the rolling.
These rolling instances started at different points on the object boundary to avoid possible correlations between the results and the local geometry of one starting point.
An expected contact movement was computed from the tangents before and after the rolling based on the object's geometry.
These tangents were determined from jaw orientations provided by the Adept controller.
The contact movement estimates were provided by the force/torque sensor.The executed motions were not pure rolling but rather their approximations.
The estimation errors were higher in instances where the jaw passed high-curvatured portions of the object boundary.
Discrepancies were likely also due to calibration inaccuracy, minor vibrations in the Adept controller, low contact friction between the plexiglass jaw and the wooden object, etc.
Experiments for localization were conducted with flat wooden parts in cubic spline shapes.
The experimental setup (with one part) is shown in Figure 4.
Four instances of localization on two different parts are shown in Figure 9.
In each instance, the jaw made the initial contact at some point , then estimation is not as robust to errors in the sensor, as in instance (c).
Total curvature estimates were simply the rotation angles of one of the Adept's joints and hence were very accurate.
But length estimates were prone to errors in the force/torque sensor and the approximation of pure rolling.
The success rate 1 of localization is currently around 45%.
This paper describes an easily implementable 2-axis force/torque sensor capable of determining contact locations and useful for simple force control.
Supported by an analysis from solid mechanics, the decoupling of strain gauge measurements simplifies sensor calibration such that no use of known load is necessary.
This has eliminated one major source of calibration error.
We have demonstrated that a special motion such as rolling on an object could be realized by a jaw mounted with the sensor, which meanwhile could localize itself on the object during the motion.The force/torque sensor is implemented with very low cost (less than $300 excluding the 16-channel data acquisition board), making it desirable for lab experiments.The accuracy of contact measurement needs further improvement.
Localization should be made more active with contact sensing and rolling conducted simultaneously instead of one after the other.
The jaw needs to be able to plan the rolling during an execution to improve the success rate (just like in a human touch).
The next step will be to demonstrate tasks such as grasping with two jaws, each equipped with a 2-axis force/torque sensor.
We would also like to experiment with the sensor on constructing unknown 2-D and 3-D shapes through planned touch motions.
